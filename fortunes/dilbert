Dilbert: I thought you were gonna wake me at 6:30?
Dogbert: I also said women like men who are shaped like potatoes. Can you find 
a pattern here?
Dilbert: I had the egg dream again.
Dogbert: "I,I,I."
Dilbert: What do you think an egg dream means?
Dogbert: Mmm, probably an omen.
Dilbert: A good omen?
Dogbert: How many good omens involve things that come out of a chicken's butt?
Dilbert: There only has to be one.
Ratbert: AAAAAAAAHH!
Dilbert: Hey, that's my bathroom. I didn't know you had your own toothbrush, 
Ratbert.
Ratbert: Why would I need my own toothbrush?
Dilbert: Good morning, shower!
Automated Shower Machine: Good morning, Dilbert!
Dogbert: Hmm, don't you do enough engineering at work?
Dilbert: Work is just meetings, this is engineering. If this works, someday all 
showers will be voice activated.
Dogbert [sitting on a stool]: Is it that hard to turn the knobs?
Dilbert: It's not that it's hard, it's unnecessary. [To ASM] 99, please.
ASM: 99. [shower turns on at 99 degrees; Dilbert steps inside]
Dogbert [aside]: 400.
[The ASM does nothing]
Dilbert: Heh-heh, nice try. But the shower is calibrated to respond to my voice 
only.
Dogbert: Why, you think of everything!
Dilbert: I'm cautious.
Dogbert: That's why you had training wheels on your bike until you were 17.
Dilbert: I was 14.
ASM: 14. [makes the shower temperature 14 degrees]
Dilbert: AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH! [is frozen in a block of ice] 99! 99! 99! [shower 
goes back to 99 degrees, as the ice melts] Don't do that!
Dogbert: Where'd you get the voice for that thing? It sounds like the voice for 
that stupid movie; what was it called, "something, something, a Space Odyssey"?
Dilbert: It wasn't "Something, something, a Space Odyssey", it was "2001: A 
Spa-" [cut to the exterior of the house, as the ASM evidently makes the shower 
temperature 2001 degrees] AAAAAAAAGGGGGGHHHHH!!!
[back inside, a red-skinned Dilbert wraps a towel around himself, which then 
catches on fire as he walks off-screen]
Dogbert: On the plus-side, you look very clean.

Dilbert: I told them at the rollout meeting that anthrax was a bacteria, not a 
herb!
Wally: No you didn't!
Dilbert: Well, I was thinking it pretty hard!
%
Executive: Bob, you're like a son to me.
Bob: You don't have a son.
Executive: That's where I'm headed here.
Bob: Oooh.
%
Dilbert: To save time, I've hired a consultant to help us find a name for our 
next product.
[The "consultant" turns around in his swivel chair and reveals himself to be 
Dogbert]
Loud Howard: He doesn't look like any consultant I've ever seen!
Dogbert [writing on a piece of paper]: Recommendation, Number One: Downsize the 
loud guy.
Loud Howard: Uh, I-I take it back!
Dogbert: Anyone else want a piece of me?
%
PHB: Well, there's no point in killing a dead horse.
Dilbert: You mean there's no point in beating a dead horse.
PHB: Why would anyone beat a dead horse?
Dilbert: Why would anyone kill a dead horse?
PHB: Maybe it kicked ya.
Dilbert: It's dead!
PHB: And so is every customer who has used our flagship product!
%
Dilbert: Do you think the guy who invented the mouse pad started with the name? 
What's a mouse pad?
Wally: Heheh, feminine protection for mice.
[Alice smacks Wally in the face with a book]
%
Accountant: Walter is good with these name things. He just named his baby.
PHB: How is Walter Jr?
Walter: She's fine, thanks for asking.
%
Dogbert: Do we have anyone here from marketing?
[A guy and a girl from marketing are making out]
Marketing girl: Lie to me!
Marketing guy: Our next upgrade will solve the problem!
Marketing girl: Ohhhh! [the two keep making out]
Dogbert: I like the sound of it, but how do you spell "uh-hoo-ah-ahhhh"?
%
Accountant: Walter has a name for the product.
Walter: How about... Ford?
Dogbert: Hmm. That seems to be taken - [slams his paper on the table] - by the 
Ford Motor Company!!
[Walter runs out crying]
Marketing guy: Maybe Ford will sell the name. Everybody has a price!
Dogbert: You're not alowed to talk anymore.

Vibrating chair store owner [speaking in a shaky voice]: Would you like to try 
a vibrating chair?
Dogbert: Get out of my way, you pervert.
%
Office worker: Help, Dilbert, I've been shot!
Dilbert: "I've been shot!", "I've been shot!"—I have a few problems of my own 
you know!
Office worker: Yeah I heard about the name thing, that's a drag…
%
Dilmom: Why don't you call your product the Gruntmaster 6000?
Dilbert: What kind of product do you see when you imagine a Gruntmaster 6000?
Dilmom: Well it's a stripped-down version of the Gruntmaster 9000 of course. 
But it's software-upgradeable.
%
Dogbert: As you probably know, all the good product names have been trademarked 
by companies who are competent.
Wally: Competent? How are we going to compete with that?
%
Boss: Ah—am I late?
PHB: Right on time sir.
Boss: Oh…in that case I've got time to make some phone calls. [leaves]
%
[Dogbert causes all the chairs in the store to vibrate wildly]
Vibrating chair store owner [shaky voice]: Will you be sitting down in any of 
these?
Dogbert: No, I'm gonna run for it and you might wanna do the same.
%
Loud Howard: The rumor is that they treat you like a human being! And I would 
love to be treated like a human being - just once!
%
Dilbert: This is impossible! How am I gonna get any work done if there's no 
tension?
%
Dilbert: What kind of madhouse is this?!
%
Dilbert: Lena's team is so big you could get lost in the crowd and never have 
to lift a finger.
Alice: They might get the big raises and party atmosphere, but they'll never 
know the satisfaction that comes from really hard work.
[Wally vanishes.]
Dilbert: You could have worded that better.
%
Fred's head: Get out while you still can.
Dilbert: Get out?
Fred's head: Can't you see? We're severed heads in a jar!
Dilbert: Well maybe it didn't work out with you guys, but that doesn't mean it 
won't work out with me. She really likes me.
%
Alice: Team Lena is going down!
Dilbert: Must one person's triumph be another's humiliation?
Alice: Of course.
%
Alice: She's making me think of sex at the same time I see you naked. Now I've 
got Dilbert and sex in the same part of my brain! Ow! Ow! Ow! Get it out!
%
Dilbert: It's so small - I can't even find it!
%
Dogbert: That's outrageous. Idiots shouldn't have money.
%
Dilbert: Hold it - were you just reading a book?
Wally: Are you bonkers - what makes you think that?
Dilbert: My own eyes.
Wally: Hardly a reliable source.
Dilbert: I just saw you!
%
Dilbert: Insider trading is illegal - you could go to jail!
PHB: Wally I'll need you to review the RFP for the BGA project before the IOC 
meeting.
Wally: Well that has alibi written all over it. Are you in?
%
Dilbert: I thought you were supposed to buy when the stock is down.
Dogbert: Have I ever lied to you?
Dilbert: About a thousand times.
Dogbert: You don't have to throw it in my face.
%
Wally: Who died and made you the Dalai Lama?
%
Wally: You do whatever you want. Me - I'm cashing out.
Dilbert: You plan to retire?
Wally: Retire? From what? I don't do anything now except surf the net - why 
should I pay for that? Besides, I really like the coffee here.
%
Stockholder: You two are going to fit right in here, and I'm referring of 
course only to Wally.
%
Dilbert: That's it! I've done it!
Dogbert: That's not the word on the street.
%
Dilbert: What are you doing with my laser?
Dogbert: Did you know there are no laws in space?
%
PHB: Look, I've worked very hard seeing the Gruntmaster 6000 through to this 
final phase of testing and I just want to say how proud I am of myself. Now if 
we can just get rid of that junk on the field maybe we can start the tests..
Dilbert: Uh, that's the Gruntmaster 6000.
PHB: Really? It's so big.
%
Dilbert: Just out of curiosity, how often does an asteroid hit an exercise 
machine?
PHB: A comet hit my Stairmaster - that's why I don't exercise anymore!
%
Dilbert: You're going into space?
Dogbert: Good observation, potato boy. I'll send you a postcard.
Dilbert: I don't think you can send a postcard from outer space.
Dogbert: Ooh, it can be done. But you might see a little jump in your next tax 
bill.
%
Wally: Hey Bob, how's it going?
Bob Bastard: Wally. [walks off with Alice]
Wally [smitten]: He called me "Wally."
Dilbert: That's your name.
Wally: There's no call for bitterness.
%
Dogbert: So, you're welcome!
Dilbert: Thanks, Dogbert. You really bailed me out.
Dogbert: Ohh, it's nothing you wouldn't have done for me if you weren't you and 
I wasn't me and everything was completely different.
%
Dilbert: You're living in the past, my furry friend. Capitalism has transformed 
Elbonia. The economy is burgeoning.
Dogbert: Nothing like slave labor to perk up the economy.
Dilbert: They're making many advances. For instance, did you realise the 
leading cause of death in Elbonia is no longer Black Plague?
Dogbert: Oh really? What is?
Dilbert: Here we go, it's.. self-inflicted gunshot wounds? Must be a typo.
%
Garbageman: Well in that case he'll need the help of someone who is incapable 
of sympathy; someone so cynical that the suffering of others is nothing but a 
source of cheap entertainment.
Dogbert: Oh alright - I'll go.
%
Dilbert: Hey, hi.
PHB: What an odd-looking people.
Alice: It's us! From work!
Dilbert: Remember?
PHB: If only I spoke your language. Do you know where the pool is? The POOL? 
Swimmy swimmy?
%
Alice and Dilbert stare at the PHB.
PHB: Ignorant wogs.
%
Dilbert: Shouldn't there be a guard-rail around that?
Elbonian: Guard-rail? Haha, what is this, an amusement park?
%
Alice: You can't put babies to work on an assembly line!
Elbonian: These are not babies. They are toddlers.
%
Dilbert: Are those people dead?
Elbonian: Technically, yes. But that's no excuse. Get to work you lazy corpse!
%
Dilbert: If you're going to change anything you're gonna have to organise.
Elbonian Worker: Now you've lost us.
%
Elbonian Dictator: You will be read your rights, given a fair trial, then 
executed. On second thought, since we have no rights, and we have no courts, 
let's go to the execution.
%
Loud Howard: I, I cough, cough I've lost my voice!

Everyone cheers
PHB: Sorry son, I couldn't hear you! Mhm, mhm, mhm.

PHB: At this time it gives me great pleasure to do this.

PHB scratches armpit
PHB: Their sacrifices are a inspiration to us all — not to mention the 
cost-savings that go directly to the bottom line.
%
PHB: Secondly, we've stocked the first aid kits with these new wonder-drugs — 
placebos [pronounced plah-see-bos].
%
Alice: I could sue you both for making this a hostile workplace.
Dilbert: Ten minutes ago you beat a man senseless.
Alice: He was senseless before I beat him.
%
Dogbert: I'll bet you 20 dollars it doesn't feel good to give. [extends hand]
Dilbert: You are on, my cynical friend! [shakes Dogbert's hand]
Dogbert: Okay, to settle the question, give me 40 dollars and then tell me if 
it feels good.
Dilbert: That wouldn't feel good.
Dogbert: Okay, then give me 20 dollars because you lost the bet.
Dilbert [puzzled look]: Did I just make a bet that would cost me 20 dollars 
whether I won or not? [hands Dogbert a $20 bill]
Dogbert [taking the money]: Yes. But you also got to help someone more 
fortunate than yourself.

Jay Leno: And you've heard about this guy? Well, he's sort of a guy. And he's 
reportedly a surrogate mother for an alien, hilbilly, robot, engineer, cow 
baby. Michael Jackson already has an order in for three of them! Part cow, part 
engineer...now do you think it'll spend a lot of the nights surfing the 
internet and milking itself?
