Narrator: Here is a model of a calcium molecule. Do you recognise the triple 
helix? If you do, write it down.
%
Narrator: The protons feed electrical information to the core of the molecule, 
where we find the central atom, or 'Queen Atom'. Were the Queen Atom to leave 
the molecule, or nest, the effects would be disastrous, as the entire structure 
would come tumbling down. This is known as the Helvetica Scenario. Shows a 
black and white German horror film of a scientist observing a man with no face 
trapped behind a window
%
Narrator: The largest number is about 45,000,000,000 although mathematicians 
suspect that there may be even larger numbers. Text on screen reads: 
45,000,000,001?
%
Narrator: Maths stands for Mathematical Anti-Telharsic Harfatum Septomin.
%
Narrator: We use maths at almost every point of the day, whether we're working 
out how to thread our shoelaces, calculating the optimal moment on which to 
embark upon a conversation, or, if you can fly, planning your trajectory for 
the journey to work.
%
Narrator: Look at this formula: . It's called cDonald's Theorem. If we plot its 
graph, we arrive at this unusual shape, a uniformly curved line which somehow 
joins up with itself that science has yet to find a name for. Can you think of 
a name for it? If you can, the Royal Mathematics Society would like to hear 
from you. Because they hold a competition each year to find a name for this 
figure. The final takes place in Nottingham on April the 4th of September. And 
you could win your school this computerized toast system. So, good luck!

Narrator: Jean is shorter than Brutus but taller than Imhotep. Imhotep is 
taller than Jean, but shorter than Lord Scotland. Lord Scotland is twice the 
height of Jean and Brutus combined but only one-tenth of the height of Millsy. 
Millsy is at a constant height of . If Jean stands exactly one nautical mile 
away from Lord Scotland, how tall is Imhotep?
%
Narrator: Eight ladies go to eight shops at eight o'clock in the morning. Each 
lady wants to buy eight spiders. For each spider, eight spider shoes must also 
be bought. But they only have eight pounds between them. With each spider 
costing eight pence and each spider shoe costing an eighth pence each, will the 
ladies have enough change for the bus home? A journey costing eight pence per 
stop and made up of eight stops.
%
Narrator: It's the future and Queen Elizabeth III and Queen Elizabeth IV are 
going to a party held by Queen Elizabeth V. They're keen to make the right 
impression so it's important that they choose their outfits carefully. Queen 
Elizabeth III has forty dresses to choose from, where as Queen Elizabeth IV has 
four thousand. Queen Elizabeth V has just one dress, but it has the ability to 
transform itself into the shape of any dress. The night before the party Queen 
Elizabeth IV’s handmaiden steals the patterns to Queen Elizabeth III's 
dresses and working through till dawn makes forty exact replicas. Can you 
calculate the probability that all three queens will be wearing the same dress 
at the party and how many times can Queen Elizabeth V's dress change before it 
overheats?
%
Narrator: Here are the answers to all your problems: Imhotep is invisible. The 
ladies were eight pence short. And the party was cancelled.%
Narrator: But what is water? It's a difficult question, because water is 
impossible to describe. One might ask the same about birds. What are birds? We 
just don't know.
%
Narrator: (cutting into a boiled egg) Make sure you look out for the release of 
the new albumen... (the egg cracks open) It's out now.
%
Narrator: Thanks, ants. Thants.
%
Narrator: The gas mafipulates gently through the Jane Grey and into the water, 
causing bubbling. The mafipulation is allowed to continue for 5 minutes.
%
Narrator: If you look carefully, you'll notice that the water has changed 
colour from invisible to brown.
%
Narrator: Bless you, ants. Blants.
%
Narrator: Germs originated in Germany, before rapidly spreading throughout the 
rest of the world.
%
Narrator: Germs are basically a malevolent form of bacteria, with one purpose: 
to spread germs.
%
Narrator: You can pick up germs from a variety of sources, and because they're 
invisible they're almost impossible to see.
%
Narrator: Moth apples are smaller than crab apples, sweeter too. Don't be 
tempted to eat them, as they are highly explosive.
%
Narrator: But there's no need to be scared of ghosts, it's a very childish 
attitude as the majority of them are quite harmless. This spirit is helping a 
girl with her homework, while this one is mending its master's caravan.
%
Narrator: Ghosts. You may know them as ghouls or demons or spirits or spirims 
or spictrims.
%
Narrator: One way in which ghosts are different from man is that they can't 
whistle. Try as they might, the most they can muster is a rather feeble hiss. 
Perhaps it's because their lips are transparent and their tongues are 
see-through?
%
Narrator: We will be using a household object famous for its iron content. Can 
you guess what it is? Correct. Champagne.
%
Narrator: (Talking about heat vision) You've probably seen this in action at 
your local dump, where it is used by the waste disposal industry.
%
Peter Jackmond: In an average year we get through roughly forty tonnes of 
sulphur. This translates into approximately two and a half million individual 
matches. Since the company was formed we've produced 156,280,000 matches, and 
if we continue at the current rate of production, by the year 3500 we will have 
manufactured 900,000 billion billion billion billion billion billion matches.
Narrator: That's a lot of matches!
%
Narrator: There are those that actually believe that this is music. They call 
it 'birdsong', but it's hardly a song. There's no real tune to speak of, just a 
cacophony of squawks and chirrups. What a racket!
%
Narrator: One can only imagine a world without music, though we'd probably get 
used to it after a while.
%
Narrator: Here's a state of the art, song-writing computer, the 'Harrington 
1200.' You've probably never seen one yourself because it costs almost a 
thousand pounds. Price tag reads £999.99½p
%
Narrator: But it's at the heart of the Harrington that we find the real musical 
motors that power this machine. DNA samples taken from the composers Gilbert 
and Sullivan.
%
Narrator: An ordinary piano. And if we go to the top of the scale we find this, 
the Boîte Diabolique, which houses the 19 forbidden notes. It's kept locked, 
and for good reason.%
Narrator: We have a DC current, provided by the battery, and an AC current, 
provided by the mains. We're working with AC/DC because it is heavy metal.
%
Narrator: An enormous pair of scissors has appeared in the sky directly above 
the laboratory, and after a few moments, it's gone. It's an old experiment that 
you've probably seen before, but well worth trying nonetheless.
%
Narrator: Here is a model of an iron molecule. And here is a model of a model, 
modeled in iron.
%
Narrator: Man has been using iron since the stone age.%
Narrator: What is the brain? If you don't know that, you've forgotten how to 
think.
%
Narrator: The brain is basically a wrinkled bag of skin, filled with warm 
water, veins and thought muscles. Think of it as a kind of modified heart, only 
with a mind or brain.
%
Narrator: The opposite of the brain is probably the bum. It's nowhere near as 
intelligent as the brain. It doesn't have to be as it only needs to make very 
basic calculations.

Narrator: You don't have to be a brain surgeon to operate on the brain.

Leonard Hatred: (on Psilence spray) Well, my parents were both heavy snorers 
and I was a light sleeper...We lived at Heathrow at first. Later we moved. But 
it was to Gatwick (laughs nervously). Then I moved to the countryside but they 
built an abattoir next to my house. And my wife has this condition where she 
screams constantly. And her sister moved in and she has the same condition...

Peter: Well, you've certainly given the ghost of Tchaikovsky something to think

Continuity Announcer: At 10:40 we have The Honey Programme, hosted by David 
Bumblebee.

Continuity Announcer: Imagine That is at 11:00, and this week the businessmen 
are trying to imagine The Two Ronnies having sex with each other.

Peter: When you hear the words "fast food", you automatically think of one 
thing: casserole.
%
Peter: Well, unfortunately, there never was an opening night. Only hours after 
that piece was filmed, Clive Pounds sadly died from complications following a 
wasp sting to his anus. And so, as a mark of respect, we will now observe a 
one-second silence.
%
Peter: And now for your special birthday surprise. It's you, Pam Bachelor, at 
age 90!
%
Continuity Announcer: Viewers may be pleased to know that Clive Pounds, who 
died during production of this program, has since come back to life.%
Continuity Announcer: Look Around You follows in a minute, but first we have 
the line up for Antmas Eve.
