misbehavior.]

paycheck to get Christmas money)
Bart: Come on, Dad. If TV has taught me anything, it's that miracles always 
happen to poor kids at Christmas. It happened to Tiny Tim, it happened to

Tim?

tell me what a kwyjibo is.
Bart: Kwyjibo. Uh... [looks at Homer] a big, dumb, balding North American ape.

Bart: Dad, I got to tell you something, hope you won't be too mad.
Homer: What is it, son?
Bart: I'm not a genius, dad.
Homer: What?
Bart: I cheated on the intelligent test, I'm sorry! But you then made the past 
few weeks great. Me and you were doing stuff together, you've helped me out 
with things, we're closer than we've ever been. I love you, dad, and I think if 
something can bring us that close, it can't possibly be bad.

would have noticed that your family sees you as a rather stern authority 
figure, an ogre, if you will.

Bart: Right on, Doc! Another successful diagnosis.
Homer: That does it!

Bart: I guess I could do that.
Homer: What?! And violate the code of the schoolyard?! I'd rather Bart die!
Marge: What on earth are you talking about, Homer?!
Homer: The code of the schoolyard, Marge! The rules that teach a boy how to be 
a man! Let's see: Don't tattle, always make fun of those different from you, 
never say anything unless you're sure everyone feels exactly the same way you 
do, and what else...?

Bart: Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, contrary to what you've just seen, 
war is neither glamorous nor fun. There are no winners, only losers. There are 
no good wars, with the following exceptions: The American Revolution, World War

lots of books in your local library, many of them with cool, gory pictures.

it'll make you happy.

when the results come back.)
Homer: Is that a good siren? Am I approved?
Bob: You ever known a siren to be good? (Chuckles) No, Mr. Simpson, it's not. 
It's a bad siren. That's the computer in case I went blind, telling me, "Sell 
the vehicle to this fella, and you're outta business." That's what the siren 
says. It seems that the Ultimate Behemoth is a wee bit out of your price range. 
And wee bit is me being polite, you couldn't afford this thing even if you 
lived to be a million.
Homer: Don't you have something that isn't out of my price range. I don't want 
to go away empty handed, Bob.
Bob: Take it easy there. Don't ruin this feeling I'm getting from you. Perhaps 
I can show you something a little more you.

Bart: Does it have its own satellite dish, sir?
Bob: You can tell your son it has its own satellite. The VanStar One, launched 
last February, just for this thing, that's all.

Brunswick.

[The words "big shoes to fill" start echoing in Bart's mind, droning out Bob's 
talking and he starts to catch onto something that others hadn't before. 
Recalling with memory, Bart remembers Homer stepped on the robber's foot, 
resulting in him screaming in pain. However, Bart noticed Krusty's feet were 
small as he walked up the steps to the courthouse. He knows that despite 
wearing big floppy clown shoes all the time, Krusty would never felt Homer 
stepping on them due to his small feet. Whereas, Sideshow Bob's feet are 
unbelievably large and therefore he yelled at Homer for not watching where he 
was going. That's when it all comes together and Bart realized that Bob had the 
most to gain in Krusty's downfall.]
Bart: [Outraged] Wait a minute, you did it!
Sideshow Bob: I beg your pardon?

fellow children! Krusty didn't rob that store! Sideshow Bob framed him and I 
got proof!

feet like all good-hearted people.

Sideshow Bob: [in handcuffs] Yes, I admit it. I hated him! His hackneyed

would've gotten away with it, too, if it weren't for these meddling kids!

Mr. Burns: Simpson, huh? Hmm. An unspoiled lump of clay to mold in my own 
image. Our new junior executive. Bring him to me!
Smithers:[on the intercom] Attention Homer Simpson, you have been promoted. You 
are now an executive. Take three minutes to say good-bye to your former friend 
and report to room 503 for reassignment to a better life.

no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hasspoken! Leave my loneliness

Dave Shutton: So, caught anything?
Lisa: Not yet, sir.
Dave Shutton: What are you using for bait?
Lisa: My brother is using worms, but I, who feel the tranquility far outweighs 
the actual catching of fish, am using nothing.
Dave Shutton: I see. What's your name, son?
Bart: I'm Bart Simpson. Who the hell are you?
Dave Shutton: (chuckling) I'm Dave Shutton, an investigative reporter who's on 
the road a lot. And I must say that in my day, we didn't speak that way to our 
elders!
Bart: Well this is my day, and we do, sir.

your glue away and then nobody will have any glue to glue with!

Lisa: Just tell me you're sorry!
Bart: Why should I?!
Lisa: Bart, the only reason to apologize is if you look deep down inside 
yourself and you find a spot, something you wish wasn't there, because you feel 
bad you hurt your sister's feelings.
Bart: Leave me alone.
Lisa: Just look!
Bart: Ok, ok. Mmmhhuummmhmmmm. Lookin' for the spot. Nananana, still checking. 
This is so stupid, I'm not gonna find anything. Just 'cause I wrecked something

[Marge is writing a letter to the producers of Itchy and Scratchy.]
Marge: Dear purveyors of senseless violence, I know this may sound silly at

their behavior in a negative way. Please try to tone down the psychotic 
violence in your otherwise fine programming. Yours truly, Marge Simpson.

Roger Meyers, Jr.: [in response to Marge's letter] Dear valued viewer, thank 
you for taking an interest in the Itchy & Scratchy program. Enclosed is a 
personally autographed photo of America's favorite cat-and-mouse team to add to 
your collection. In regards to your specific comments about the show, our 
research shows that one person cannot make a difference, no matter how big a 
screwball she is, so let me close by saying...
Marge: [reading the letter out loud] And the horse I rode in on? I'll show them 
what one screwball can do!

Roger Meyers, Jr. {dictating from random letter}: I think your violent 
programming is despicable. From this day forward I will not watch your show, 
buy any of your products, or brake if I see you crossing the street.

Roger Meyers, Jr.: Gentlemen, we have a problem. Marge Simpson has made herself

agony in the pits of Hell! And you were there! And you and you and you. [to 
Lionel Hutz] You, I've never seen before.
Homer: Hey, yeah, who are you? I saw you chasing Bart's ambulance.
Lionel Hutz: Hutz is the name, Mr. Simpson. Lionel Hutz, attorney-at-law.

Bart?

Blue-Haired Lawyer: Maybe a settlement.

overpriced, under-brained glorified notary publics! Just get that big ape to my 
house tonight and we'll pile off with a banana or two!
[Homer is infuriated when Mr. Burns insults him in another room.]
%
[While spying on Homer and Marge in the next room, Burns almost feels like he's 
having a panic attack when he hears Homer abrasively refusing his settlement.]
Homer: I'll tell you what I think. I think he thinks that I'm an idiot. The 
only reason he's offering us this is because he knows he's going to lose the 
trial and will have to pay us the coal million. $500,000, I spit at his 
$500,000.
[Homer attempts to spit at the offered check, but misses and hits a chair. 
While he tries to clean off the chair, Marge finally loses her patience with 
Homer's behavior and voices her opinion in wanting to accept the money.]
Marge: Homer, what's happened to you? All this greediness, lying, the shifty 
lawyers and the phony doctors.
Mr. Burns: [realizes Homer's been using a quack] Phony doctors, hello!
Marge: Do you know what I'd settle for if it were up to me? Bart's medical 
bills and an apology!

both Homer and Marge on their way out by releasing the hounds on them.]

[Mr. Burns' Lawyer walks up to an unprepared Marge.]
Blue-Haired Lawyer: Mrs. Simpson, does the name Julius Hibbert mean anything to 
you?
Marge: Yes, he's been our family physician and trusted friend ever since the 
day I became a mother. He's seen us through everything from colds to tempitigo 
all with competence, love and care.
Blue-Haired Lawyer: But, wait a minute, I'm confused. We just heard expert 
testimony from one Dr. Nick Riviera. What is your opinion on him?
[Marge becomes nervous and hesitant, which makes Mr. Burns' lawyer very 
impatient with her. Hutz looks concerned as everyone else peers behind him in 
suspicion after hearing Marge's testimony discrediting his claims of Dr. 
Riviera being the Simpsons' family physician by admitting to having Dr. Hibbert 
being their family physician.]
Blue-Haired Lawyer: Mrs. Simpson!
Marge: I'm sorry, but my mother always said if you don't have anything nice to 
say, don't say anything at all.
Homer: Will that hold up in court?
Hutz: [glumly admitting] No, I tried that before.
%
Blue-Haired Lawyer: Mrs. Simpson, what is your opinion on Dr. Riviera? And let 
me remind you that you're under oath!
Marge: [On Dr. Riviera] Well, to be honest, he seemed to be more concerned in 
wrapping Bart in bandages than making him feel better and he mispronounced 
words that even I know, like abdomen. And his office was dirty. Now that I 
think about it, I'm not sure that he's even a doctor.
Homer: [Feels betrayed by Marge's testimony, while Lisa who is holding Maggie, 
is proud of her for doing the right thing.] D'oh!
Blue-Haired Lawyer: And Mrs. Simpson, can you describe to us in your own words, 
Bart's intense mental anguish and suffering.
[Bart smiles, but Marge continues telling the truth.]
Marge: Well, I don't know how intense it was, but I guess he missed three days 
of school. Although he doesn't like school all that much, so that doesn't count 
as anguish. But it was a little hard on me having him around the house all the 
time.
[Bart frowns at Marge, also feels betrayed by her for testifying against both 
Hutz and Homer.]
Blue-Haired Lawyer: Could you put a dollar amount on all these hardships?
Marge: Well, we pay Bart $5 a week to take out the trash. I suppose if he'd 
been able to do it, we might have given him the $5.
Blue-Haired Lawyer: $5?! But your lawyer, assuming he is a lawyer, is asking 
for a million. Well, I guess we can't blame him for trying, can we? Thank you 
very much, Mrs. Simpson.
[Homer and Hutz are downbeat, while Mr. Burns chuckles in delight after hearing 
that Marge's honest testimony has destroyed their feeble attempt.]

Mr. Burns: I'm going to write a figure on this piece of paper. It's not quite 
as large as the last one, but I think you'll find it fair.
[He draws a giant zero on a paper and hands it to Homer and Hutz.]
Hutz: (realizes that he and Homer both lost the case) I think we should take it.
%
[At the Simpsons' house, a downbeat Homer blames Marge for testifying against 
Hutz and costing him a million dollars.]
Homer's Brain: A million dollars. My wife cost me a million dollars.
Marge: Homer, would you like some more macaroni and cheese?
Homer's Brain: Yeah, a million dollars worth, you treacherous snake woman.
Homer: No, thank you.
Marge: Some string beans?
Homer's Brain: No, I don't want any string beans either, you two-timing, 
backstabbingâ€”Uh-oh. Better answer.
Homer: No, thank you.
Marge: Some celery with cream cheese on it?
Homer's Brain: Just mouth polite nothings.
Homer: No, thank you.
[Bart then breaks the silence by wishing to have won the case against Burns and 
won the $1 million. Marge is unhappy with his suggestion, after she did the 
right thing to stop the case from continuing.]
Marge: Bart, please.

ever return home to a wife who betrayed him by testifying for Burns.]

Dr. Hibbert: Now, a little death anxiety is normal. You can expect to go

Burns' office] Well, thanks for your time.
Mr. Burns: What makes a man endanger his job and... yes, even his life, by 
asking me for money?
Smithers: People like dogs, Mr. Burns.
Mr. Burns: Nonsense! Dogs are idiots. Think about it, Smithers: if I came into 
your house and started sniffing at your crotch and slobbering all over your 
face, what would you say?
Smithers: [pause] If you did it, Sir?
Mr. Burns: Exactly! You'd be fit to be tied! Dogs! [scoffs]

Grampa: We can't bust heads like we used to. But we have our ways. One trick is 
to tell stories that don't go anywhere. Like the time I caught the ferry to 
Shelbyville. I needed a new heel for m'shoe. So I decided to go to Morganville, 
which is what they called Shelbyville in those days. So I tied an onion to my 
belt. Which was the style at the time. Now, to take the ferry cost a nickel, 
and in those days, nickels had pictures of bumblebees on 'em. Gimme five bees 
for a quarter, you'd say. Now where was I... oh yeah. The important thing was 
that I had an onion tied to my belt, which was the style at the time. You 
couldn't get white onions, because of the war. The only thing you could get was 
those big yellow ones..

Apu: Why, I'm so sorry. Please accept five pounds of frozen shrimp. [Homer 
picks, sniffs shrimp]
Homer: This shrimp isn't frozen â€“ and it smells funny!
Apu: Okay, ten pounds.
Homer: Woo-hoo!
Cut to an ambulance speeding down the street

Kent Brockman: Good evening, here's an update on last week's nursing home 
exposÃ©, "Geezers in Freezers" â€“ it turns out the rest home was adequately 
heated; the footage you saw was of a fur-storage facility. We've also been told 
to apologize for using the term "geezers". Now, coming up next, "The Case of 
the Cantankerous Old Geezer."
%
Kent: We've come up with a camera so tiny it fits into this oversized novelty 
hat. [puts hat on Homer, straining on pain] Now, go get us some incriminating 
footage. And remember: you have to get in and out for 10 minutes, or you suffer 
permanent neck damage.
Man: [neck horribly bent] He's not kiddin'.
[Homer walks towards the Kwik-E-Mart doors, swaying and weaving. Apu watches 
him, curious. Kent and others watch through the camera in the surveillance van]
Apu: Huh?
Homer: Don't be alarmed, Apu. Just go about your daily routine like I'm not 
wearing the hat.
Apu: Your headgear seems to be emitting a buzzing noise, sir. Perhaps you have 
a bee in your bonnet.
Homer: Bee? Agh! Woo! Woo! Agh-agh-agghh! [Stomps on the hat and runs out. 
Homer returns to the van, gasping for air]
Kent: Homer, that hat's been with the station for twenty years. He had one day 
left 'til retirement.
%
Homer: Apu, if I've learned anything, it's that life is just one crushing 
defeat after another until you just wish Flanders was dead.
%
Apu: He is the benevolent, enlightened president and CEO of Kwik-E-Mart â€“ and 
in Ohio, Stop-O-Mart. [CEO slurps his Squishee] He is the one I must ask to get 
my job back.
CEO: Approach, my sons.
[Homer and Apu approach the CEO's meditation point]
CEO: You may ask me three questions.
Apu: That's great, because I only need one.
Homer: [interrupting] Are you really the head of the Kwik-E-Mart?
CEO: Yes.
Homer: Really?
CEO: Yes.
Homer: You?
CEO: Yes. I hope this has been enlightening for you.
Apu: But â€“ I mustâ€”
CEO: Thank you, come again.
Apu: Butâ€”
CEO: Thank you, come again.
[Homer and Apu leave the convenient store]
Homer: Well, that was a big bust. Is he really the head of the Kwik-E-Mart? 
[Apu growls, reaches towards Homer] No need to apologize, Apu â€“ it was as 
much my fault as it was yours. [Apu pounces and strangles Homer] Okay, Apu ... 
I accept your apology! [both fight, topple off the path and fall down the 
mountain side]

Malibu Stacy Doll: Don't ask me. I'm just a girl! Ha ha, ha ha!
Bart: Right on, say it, sister.
Lisa: It's not funny, Bart. Millions of girls will grow up thinking that this 
is the right way to act - that they can never be more than vacuous ninnies 
whose only goal in life is to look pretty, land a rich husband, and spend all 
day on the phone with their equally vacuous friends talkin' about how damned 
terrific it is to look pretty and have a rich husband!
Bart: Just what I was gonna say.
(Lisa angrily throws the doll out the living room window. Cut to Grampa Simpson 
riding a bike down the street)
Grampa Simpson: Look at me! I'm acting young!
(The doll gets caught in the spokes of the bicycle. Grampa Simpson flies off 
screaming past a blur of colors until he lands in an open grave at a cemetery. 
Two grave diggers having lunch turn around to see what the commotion is, then 
resume eating)
Grampa Simpson (from inside the grave): Hey, this ain't so bad.
%
[Lisa pressures Stacy Lovell about Malibu Stacy.]
Stacy: I see exactly what you mean; this is a problem. But what do you expect 
me to do?
Lisa: Change what she says. It's your company.
Stacy: Not since I was forced out in 1974. They said my way of thinking just 
wasn't cost effective.
Lisa: [gasps] That's awful.
Stacy: Well, that and â€” I was funneling profits to the Viet Cong.

[Smithers turns on his computer, its boot screen displays a computerized 
version of Mr. Burns]
Mr. Burns: Hello, Smithers. You're quite good at turning me on.
Smithers: Uh, you probably should ignore that.
%
Burns: Compadres, it is imperative that we crush the freedom fighters before 
the start of the rainy season! And remember: a shiny new donkey for whoever 
brings me the head of Colonel Montoya. [Smithers whispers to him] Hmm?... 
What?... Oh, and by that I mean, of course, it's time for the "Worker of the 
Week Award".
%
Stillwater: People, we're in danger of losing our funding. America isn't 
interested in space exploration anymore.
Babcock: Maybe we should finally tell them the big secret, that all the chimps 
we sent into space came back super intelligent.
[A chair swivels around, revealing a chimp in a suit, wearing glasses, and 
smoking a pipe.]
Chimp: [English accent] No, I don't think we'll be telling them that.
%
Reporter: Uh, question for the barbecue chef: Don't you think there is an 
inherent danger in sending underqualified civilians into space?
Homer: I'll field this one. The only danger is if they send us to that terrible 
Planet of the Apes. [thinks for a moment] Wait a minute, Statue of Liberty - 
that was our planet! You maniacs! You blew it up! Damn you! Damn you all to 
hell!

NASA Technician: [counting down to launch] Three... Two... One... MAKE ROCKET

Kent: We're just about to get our first pictures from inside the spacecraft 
with "average-naut" Homer Simpson, and we'd like to.

Buzz Aldrin: Careful, they're ruffled!
%
[Ned has just offered Homer tickets to the game]
Homer: Why do you mock me, Lord?
Marge: Homer, that's not God. That's just a waffle Bart threw up there
[Marge knocks it down]
Homer: I know I shouldn't eat thee but... Mmmm, sacralicious.
%
[Mr. Burns talking to football players before the game]
Mr. Burns: Men, there's a little crippled boy sitting in a hospital who wants 
you to win this game. I know because... I crippled him myself to inspire you.
[Cuts to Milhouse lying in a hospital bed with a broken leg and his parents at 
his side.]
Milhouse: I hope they win or Mr. Burns said he's coming back.
%
[Homer, Bart, and Lisa discuss their plans after breakfast.]
Bart: After breakfast, me and Milhouse are goin' down to the ravine. We got a 
tip from a five-year-old that there's a dead Martian down there.
Lisa: And I'm going to jam with the Little White Girls Blues Quartet. [to 
Homer]: Wanna come with me, Daddy-o?
Homer: Sorry, honey. I'd love to, but Daddy has to go to a beer-drinking 
contest.
Bart: Think you'll win?
Homer: Son, when you participate in sporting events, it's not whether you win 
or lose; it's how drunk you get.
%
Homer: What'the point of all this cleaning?! Are we so vain?!
%
Kent Brockman: So isn't that what we're all asking in our own lives â€“ 
"Where's my elephant?" I know that's what I've been asking.
%
Mr. Burns: [rides on Stampy] Ha-ha! Smithers, this reminds me of that fat man I 
used to ride to work!
%
Homer: Look at this, Marge: $58 and all of it profit! I'm the smartest 
businessman in the world.
Marge: Stampy's food bill today was $300.
Homer: [scared] Marge, please, don't humiliate me in front of the money.
%
Lisa: Mr. Blackheart?
Mr. Blackheart: Yes, my pretty?
Lisa: Are you an ivory dealer?
Mr. Blackheart: [chuckles] Little girl, I've had lots of jobs in my day: Whale 
hunter, seal clubber, president of the Fox network ... and like most people, 
yeah, I've dealt a little ivory.
%
Homer: He took Bart too?! [yells out the window] THAT WASN'T PART OF OUR DEAL 
BLACKHEART! THAT. WASN'T. PAAAAART!
%
Grampa: Hey, they're playing the elephant song!
Jasper: I love that. Reminds me of elephants.
%
[At Springfield Police Station]
Chief Wiggum: [sarcastically] Yeah, right, lady: an elephant ran through your 
front yard. OK. [goes to another line] Wiggum...yeah, right, mister, mm hm. An 
elephant just knocked over your mailbox. OK. [goes to another line] 
Wiggum...Yeah, right, buddy, liquor store robbery, officer down. Sure...and I'm 
Edward G. Robinson!
%
Smithers: I got a mink chamois, sir. I hope it-- [gasp] Oh, my God, Mr. Burns 
is dead! Aw! Why do the good always die so young?
Mr. Burns: [emerges, strangles Smithers] You almost killed me!
Smithers: Please, sir... [places towel on Burns' shoulders] you'll catch..cold.

Nelson Muntz: Give me your fortune or I'll pound your withered old face in!
Mr. Burns: Ooh, I like his energy. Put him on the callback list.
Martin Prince: [Singing] "Clang, clang, clang went the trolley. Ring, ring, 
ring went the bell. Zing, zing, sing went my heartstrings...
[Nelson punches Martin in stomach]
Martin Prince: OW!
Mr. Burns: Thank you. Give the bully an extra point.
%
[a stone suddenly crashes through Burns' library glass window, landing at his 
feet]
Mr. Burns: Oh, look. A bird has become petrified and lost its sense of 
direction.
Smithers: I think it is a rock, sir.
Mr. Burns: We'll see what the lab has to say about that.
%
Deprogrammer: Mr. and Mrs. Simpson, your son has clearly been brainwashed by 
the evil and charismatic Mr. Burns.
Marge: Are you sure you can get him back for us?
Deprogrammer: Absolutely. I'm the one who successfully deprogrammed Jane Fonda, 
you know.
Marge: What about Peter Fonda?
Deprogrammer: Oh, that was a heartbreaker. But I did get Paul McCartney out of 
Wings.
Homer: You idiot! He was the most talented one!
%
[Bart turns on his model train and it leave the room]
Milhouse: Where does it go?
Bart: I don't know, but it won't be back for 3 hours, one time it had snow on 
it.
%
Superintendent Chalmers: Seymour, you're fired.
Principal Skinner: Did you just call me a liar?
Superintendent Chalmers: No, I said you were fired.
Principal Skinner: Oh. That's much worse.
%
Bart: Come on, Chalmie, you fired Skinner for less than this.
Superintendent Chalmers: Yeah, I did, but... Skinner really bugged me. Besides, 
the way America's public schools are sliding, they'll all be this way in a few 
months. I say, lay back and enjoy it, it's a hell of a toboggan ride.
Ned: [over PA] Well, cockly-doodly-doo, little buddies. Let's thank the Lord 
for another beautiful school day.
Superintendent Chalmers: Thank the Lor-- thank the Lord? That sounded like a 
prayer. A prayer. A prayer in a public school! God has no place within these 
walls, just like facts have no place within organized religion. Simpson, you 
get your wish. Flanders is history!
%
Bart: Wow, that is the big Rice Krispie square I've ever seen! The rich sure 
know how to live.
%
Homer: [lowers a table out of the hotel window; then drops it] Got it, Barn?
Barney: [offscreen, below hotel] Got what? [table drops on his head] Ow!
Principal Skinner: You're stealing a table?
Homer: I'm not stealing it. Hotels expect you to take a few things. It's a 
souvenir!
Principal Skinner: Ah... Is that my necktie you're wearing?
Homer: Souvenir.
%
Scott Christian: Let's go over to the county courthouse live to Kent Brockman.
Kent Brockman: â€”ockman, just outside the county courtroom where an argument 
about chowder has spilled over into the biggest trial in Springfield history. 
Behind these doors, a federal judge will ladle out steaming bowls of rich, 
creamy justice in a case the media have dubbed "Beat-Up Waiter". (pfft) This 
reporter suggested "Waitergate", but was shouted down at the press club. Now, 
it's illegal to televise court proceedings in this state, [whispers] so we'll 
have to be quiet. [courtroom doors close to his face] Doohâ€”!
%
Bart: Mom, what if there's a really bad, crummy guy who's going to jail, but I 
know he's innocent?
Marge: Well, Bart, your Uncle Arthur used to have a saying: "Shoot 'em all and 
let God sort them out." Unfortunately, one day he put his theory into practice. 
It took 75 Federal Marshals to bring him down. Now let's never speak of this 
again.
Bart: Mom, what if I can get this guy off the hook? Should I do it?
Marge: Honey, you should listen to your heart... and not the voices in your 
head, like a certain uncle did one gray December morn.
%
Chief Wiggum: Oh, my God... Someone's taken a bite out of the big Rice Krispie 
square! ...Oh, yeah, and the waiter's been brutally beaten, heh-heh.
%
Homer: What does "sequestered" mean?
Skinner: It means if we're deadlocked we'll be put up somewhere until we reach 
a decision.
Homer: What does "deadlocked" mean?
Skinner: It means the jury cannot reach a unanimous decision.
Homer: Uh-huh. And "if"?
Skinner: Conjunction meaning "in the event that" or "on condition that".
Homer: So IF we cannot reach a decision, the jury will be DEADLOCKED, and then 
we'll be SEQUESTERED in the Springfield Palace Hotel.
Patty: That's not going to happen, Homer.
Jasper: Let's go. My liver is failing.
Homer: Where we'll get free rooms, free food, free TV, free HBO, OOOH! FREE 
WILLY!
Skinner: Justice is not a frivolous thing, Simpson. It has little, if anything, 
to do with a disobedient whale. Now let's vote.
Homer: What are all of you voting?
Everyone: Guilty.
Homer: Uh-huh. How many S's in innocent?
Everyone: *groans*
Homer: Now I'm only doing what I think is right. I believe Freddy Quimby should 
walk out of here a free hotel.
%
Principal Skinner: I know you can read my thoughts, Bart. Just a little 
reminder: If I find out you cut class, your ass is mine. Yeah, you heard me. I 
think words I would never say.
Homer: I know you can read my thoughts, boy. Meow-meow-meow-meow, 
meow-meow-meow-meow, meow-meow-meow-meow-meow-meow-meow-meow.
%
Marge: Homer, you didn't do a very good job frosting Maggie's birthday cake.
[The cake reads, "Happy Birthday Magaggie".]
Homer: What? It's not Magaggie's birthday?
%
Homer: If he marries your mother, Marge, we'll be brother and sister. And then 
our kids... they'll be horrible freaks with pink skin, no overbites, and five 
fingers on each hand!
[Homer imagines his children as humans.]
Homer: Aggh!
%
Mrs. Bouvier: Oh, Monty, I swear you're the devil himself.
Mr. Burns: I...Who told you?! ...Oh, ah, yes.
%
[Homer and Marge are discussing ways for Homer to better himself.]
Homer: Oh... and how is education supposed to make me feel smarter? Besides, 
every time I learn something new, it pushes some old stuff out of my brain. 
Remember when I took that home wine-making course and I forgot how to drive?
Marge: That's because you were drunk!
Homer: And how.
%
[Reverend and Mrs. Lovejoy are talking to Marge.]
Reverend Lovejoy: Get a divorce.
Helen Lovejoy: Mmm-hmm.
Marge: But isn't that a sin?
Reverend Lovejoy: Marge, just about everything is a sin. [holds up a Bible] You 
ever sat down and read this thing? Technically, we're not allowed to go to the 
bathroom.
%
Nelson: Hey Bart, your epidermis is showing!
Bart: It is? [Bart looks in vain for the problem, only to overbalance and fall 
from the treehouse, then screams with a girlish scream] 
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh!!!!
Nelson: [talking to Kearney as Bart plummets] You see, "epidermis" means your 
hair. [Bart lands with a thud] So technically it's true; that's what makes it 
so funny. Pardon me a moment. Ha ha!
Milhouse: Hey Nelson, he's really hurt. I think he broke his leg.
Nelson: I said, "Ha, ha."
%
Hibbert: I'm sorry, that leg's going to have to come off. [Homer and Bart 
gasps] Ha, ha, ha. Did I say "leg"? I meant that wet bathing suit. I'm afraid 
you'll need a cast on that broken bone.
Bart: Aw, I'm going to miss the whole summer.
Homer: Don't worry, boy. When you get a job like me, you'll miss every summer.
%
Marge: This was a lovely idea, Homie. Come here and kiss me.
Homer: Mmm... Uh-h-h-- [a rotor system is heard and a spotlight interrupts]
Homer/Marge: AAAAAGGGGGHHHHH!!!!!
Chief Wiggum: [through a megaphone] Do not be alarmed. Continue swimming naked. 
Aw, come on! Continue! C'mon! Aww... [to Lou] All right, Lou, open fire.
%
[After hearing a woman scream from inside Flanders' house, Bart looks outside 
and sees him digging a hole in his yard]
Bart: This can't be what it looks like. There's gotta be some other explanation.
Ned Flanders: I wish there was some other explanation for this. But there 
isn't. I'm a murderer, I'm a murderer!
Bart: Then that's not the real Ned Flanders.
Ned: I'M A MUR-DIDDLY-URDLER!
Bart: If that's not Flanders, he's done his homework.
%
Homer: [after they build a barn from a pool kit] Alright, everybody in the pool!
Amish Farmer: 'Tis a fine barn, but sure 'tis no pool, English.
Homer: D'oh-eth!
%
Bart: Well, I guess that explains everything.
Homer: Not everything. [talking to Ned] There's still the little matter of the 
whereabouts of your wife.
Maude: Uh, I'm right here.
Homer: Oh, I see. Then I guess everything's wrapped up in a neat little package!
[Everybody looks at him]
Homer: Really, I mean that. Sorry if it sounded sarcastic.

Largo: Ohh â€“ that was a close one, Lisa, but you made it.
Lisa: [ecstatic] I won first chair?
Largo: No, you regained consciousness; Allison got first chair.
Lisa: AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!
Lisa blacks out
Lisa: Huh ...? Oh, it's just a dream.
Largo: Ohh â€“ that was a close one, Lisa, but you made it.
Lisa: [ecstatic] I won first chair?
Largo: No, you regained consciousness; Allison got first chair. And believe me, 
this is not a dream!
Lisa: AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!

[Homer and Bart come across an overturned truck that is spilling sugar. Homer 
shovels sugar into his car]
Bart: Dad, is this not stealing?
Homer: Read your town charter, boy! It says in writing: "If any foodstuffs 
should touch the ground, said foodstuffs shall become property of the village 
idiot". Since I don't see him around, start shoveling!
%
Homer: And you don't think I made any money. I found a dollar while waiting for 
the bus.
Marge: While you were out "earning" that dollar, you lost $40 by not going to 
work. The plant called and said if you don't come in tomorrow, don't bother 
coming in Monday.
Homer: Woo-hoo! Four-day weekend!
%
Marge: Look, just give up the sugar, okay?!
Homer: Never! Never, Marge. I can't live the button-down life like you. I want 
it all: the terrifying lows, the dizzying highs, the creamy middles. Sure, I 
might offend a few of the bluenoses with my cocky stride and musky odors -- oh, 
I'll never be the darling of the so-called â€˜City Fathersâ€™ who cluck their 
tongues, stroke their beards, and talk about "What's to be done with this Homer 
Simpson?"
%
Homer: [drowsy and in a Cuban accent] In America... first you get the sugar... 
then you get the power... then you get the women.
%
Homer: Lisa, stop that racket, I'm trying to fix your mother's camera. Easy... 
easy... [smashes camera] Hmmm... I'm gonna need a bigger drill.
%
[Rain squall has dissolved Homer's sugar heap]
Homer: NOOOO!! My sugar is melting! MELTING! Oh, what a world!
Marge: I'm sorry, Homer.
Homer{composed}: It's okay, Marge. I learned my lesson. A mountain of sugar is 
too much for one man. That is why God dispenses it in those tiny packets and he 
lives on a plantation in Hawaii.
%
Bart: Hey, everybody! Look at me! Turn this way right now!
Sherri: Hey, it's Bart!
Milhouse: And he's doing stuff!
Principal Skinner: Bart, stop creating a diversion and get out of here!

Principal Skinner: Ugh, now we're into the dregs. Here's Ralph Wiggum's 
entry... Pre-packaged Star Wars figures still in their display boxes? Are those 
the limited edition action figures?
Ralph: What's a diorama?
Principal Skinner: There's Luke... And Obi-Wan! And my favourite, Chewie! 
They're all here! What do you think?
Miss Hoover: I think it's lunchtime.
Principal Skinner: WE HAVE A WINNER!

Ralph: I beat the smart kids, I beat the smart kidâ€”oh! [Ralph's action 
figures falls, and their heads come off] I bent my Wookiee.

[Bart and Lisa are watching Itchy and Scratchy. Marge enters (in reused footage 
from earlier episode]
Marge:: How many times can you laugh at that cat getting hit by the moon?
Bart: It's a new episode.
Lisa: Not exactly. They pieced it together from old shows, but it seems new to 
the trusting eyes of impressionable youth.
Bart: [switches to new footage] Really?
Lisa: Ren & Stimpy do it all the time.
Marge: Yes, they do, but when was the last time you heard anyone talk about Ren 
& Stimpy?
%
Lisa: Mom, romance is dead. It was acquired in a hostile takeover by Hallmark 
and Disney, homogenized, and sold off piece by piece.

(Marge tries to talk to Homer about their love life, but Homer is half-asleep)
Homer: Marge, it's 3:00 a.m. and I've been working all day.
Marge: It's 9:30 p.m. and you spent your whole Saturday drinking beer in 
Maggie's kiddie pool!
(cut to reused footage from season four's New Kid on the Block of Homer digging 
a half-eaten hot dog out of a kiddie pool)
Homer: There you are. Thought you could get away! (eats it)
%
Lisa: Dad! Remember when we asked you if we could go to Itchy & Scratchy Land 
and you said it'd be too damned expensive?
Homer: Oh, everything's too damned expensive these days. Look at this Bible I 
just bought, fifteen bucks! And talk about a preachy book, everyone's a sinner. 
Except for this guy.

Narrator: Roger Myers' next full-length feature was the wildly successful

chemistry", do they? [someone throws a toilet that nearly hits Bob] Oh, really 
now, this is a personal call!
%
Judge: But why?
Sideshow Bob: Because you need me, Springfield. Your guilty conscience may 
force you to vote Democratic, but deep down, you secretly long for a 
cold-hearted Republican to lower taxes, brutalize criminals and rule you like a 
king. That's why I did it- to save you from yourselves.

Smithers: I've never gone behind Mr. Burns' back before but Sideshow Bob's 
ultra-conservative views, er, conflict with my...choice of lifestyle. All I can 
do is give you one name: Edgar Neubauer. Find him, and you'll find your answer.

Marge: Have you noticed any change in Bart?
Homer: New glasses?
Marge: No... he looks like something might be disturbing him.
Homer: Probably misses his old glasses.
Marge: I guess we could get more involved in Bart's activities but then I'd be 
afraid of smothering him.
Homer: Yeah, and then we'd get the chair.
Marge: That's not what I meant.

Homer: Sports-sports-sports-sports-sports-sports-sports-sports. Marge, Bart 
rides up in the front seat today because he's a good guy at sports.

front too?

on- her- sweet can... so I grabbed- her- sweet can... -Oh, just thinking about- 
her- can... -I just wish I had- her- sweet, sweet- s-s-sweet can...
Godfrey Jones: So, Mr. Simpson, you admit you grabbed her can. What do you have 
to say in your defense? (a paused shot of Homer is seen) Mr. Simpson, your 
silence will only incriminate you further. (the frozen image of Homer begins to 
slowly zoom in] No, Mr. Simpson, don't take your anger out on me! Get back! Get 
back! M-Mr. Simpson, noooo! (the screen freezes on the screaming Godfrey)

Kent Brockman: This is hour 57 of our live, round-the-clock coverage outside 
the Simpson estate. Remember, by the way, to tune in at 8:00 for highlights of 
today's vigil, including when the garbage man came and when Marge Simpson put 
the cat out... possibly because it was harassed, we don't know. Of course, 
there's no way to see into the Simpson home without some kind of infrared 
heat-sensitive camera. So, let's turn it on. Now, this technology is new to me, 
but, I'm pretty sure that's Homer Simpson in the oven, rotating slowly. 
(closeup of a turkey in a rotisserie) His body temperature has risen to over 
400 degrees; he's literally stewing in his own juices. [in the TV studio] Now, 
here are some results from our phone-in poll: 95% of the people believe Homer 
Simpson is guilty. Of course, this is just a television poll which is not 
legally binding, unless Proposition 304 passes; and we all pray it will.

Grampa: Welcome home, son. I broke two lamps and lost all your mail. What's

Homer: No.
Grampa: Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis?
Homer: No.
Grampa: Unsatisfying sex life?
Homer: N-- Yes! But please, don't you say that word.
Grampa: What? [shouts] Sex? What's so unappealing about hearing your elderly 
father talk about sex? I had sex.
Homer: [groans]

Lisa: Mom, Dad, this biography of Peter Ueberroth is only 99 cents. And I found

Reasonable Future".

Homer: Throughout your whole life, you've not said one nice thing to me.
Grampa: That's because you're a screw-up.
Homer: You're a screw-up!
Grampa: Why you... [proceeds to strangle Homer, who eventually thrusts him away]
Homer: All right, that's it! We're going home! I'm sick of you and your stupid 
tonic.
Grampa: If I hadn't invented that tonic some 30 years ago, you'd have never 
been born and I would have been happy! YOU WERE AN ACCIDENT!
[Homer gasps and stops the car]
Homer: [angry] GET OUT!
Grampa: I'm sorry I said that.
Homer: [still angry] OUT!

Bart: Cheer up, Homer.
Homer: Can't.
Bart: Okay!
Marge: What if you pretended that this couch were a bar? Then you could spend 
more nights at home with us. Huh?
Homer: I'm not going to dignify that with an answer.
Lisa: Look on the bright side, Dad. Did you know that the Chinese use the same 
word for "crisis" as they do for "opportunity"?
Homer: Yes! Cris-a-tunity. You're right. I've been wasting my life away in that 
dump for years. That's it! I'm going to find a new bar to drink in, and I'm 
going to get drunker than I've ever been in my entire life! Bart! Where's my 
wallet?
Bart: [pulling it from his own pocket] Right here, Dad!

I'll sell the bar.
Norm: Hey Woody, get me a beer.
Woody: I think you've had enough, Mr. Peterson. My chiropractor says I can't 
carry you home anymore.
Norm: Just give me another beer, you brain-dead hick! [stands up and smashes a 
bottle] I'll kill you! I'll kill all of you!

Homer: Wait a minute... There's something bothering me about this place. 
[gasps] I know! This lesbian bar doesn't have a fire exit! Enjoy your

Lesbian: What was her problem?

Homer: The last bar in Springfield. If they don't let me in here, I'm going to

Airport Worker: We need a pilot, pronto! Who wants to fly to the Windy City?

Airport Worker: You! [points at Homer]
Homer: But I...
Airport Worker: Hey! You're not just impersonating a pilot so you can drink 
here, are you?
Homer: Yeah. That's exactly why I'm here.
Airport Worker: [laughs] You flyboys, you crack me up.

Homer: Come on, Marge, I want to shake off the dust of this one-horse town. I 
want to explore the world. I want to watch TV in a different time zone. I want 
to visit strange, exotic malls. I'm sick of eating hoagies. I want a grinder, a 
sub, a foot-long hero. I want to live, Marge! Won't you let me live? Won't you, 
please?!

Homer: Eh, I'm sure it's nothin'.
Lisa: Mom, are you feeling any better?
Marge: Yes, but I'd rather not talk about it.
Homer: Permit me to solve the mystery: your mother has a fear of flying.

Marge: Everyone has a fear of something.
Homer: Not everyone.

Marge: No, no, honey, it's all right. Really, I'm fine, I'm all right. Mother 
always said, "Don't complain. Be good. Behave. Behave. Be nice. Smile. Be 
polite. Don't make waves..." [walks out]
Homer: You heard your mother's ramblings. She's fine, so behave.
%
Lisa: Mom, can we talk to you?
Marge: Can't talk. Keeping myself in a state of catlike readiness.
Lisa: Uh, neat. Anyway, Mom, maybe you should go into therapy.
Marge: I don't need therapy, I'm fine; and it's too expensive.
Homer: And I don't believe in it! It breaks up families, turns wives against 
husbands, children against fathers, neighbors against me. You don't have to pay 
some fancy psychiatrist 10 bucks an hour to get top-notch therapy.
%
Lisa: Dad, Mom's getting worse. You need to get her to a real psychiatrist; 
look how tense she is.
Homer: She's fine. [realises Marge is sitting down with no sofa under her] Oh.
%
Homer: [sarcastically] All right, Lisa, you got your way. Your mom's going to a 
psychiatrist. She's going to tell Marge to leave me. It'll break up the family 
and you'll have to live with your grandmother and pick beans.
Lisa: Dad, I like picking beans with Grandma.
Homer: Well, keep it up, then.
Lisa: [sarcastically] Okay, I will.
Homer: Good. You do that.
Lisa: Fine.
Homer: You'll be picking many a bean.
Lisa: Hope I do.

Lisa: Beware the Ides of March.
Homer: No.
Lisa: Dad, I know you think you're happy now, but it's not gonna last forever.
Homer: Everything lasts forever.
Lisa: Don't you see? Getting what you want all time will ultimately leave you 
unfulfilled and joyless.

Homer: [being spanked again] Ow ow ow ow ow ow! [on the other side of the line] 
Hey, have ya ever noticed that the Crossing the Desert is a lot like the

Gettysburg.

Marge: [walking in] Homer, you can't just keep hanging out with these globus 
monkeys. Somebody's going to get parasites.

work.

Congratulations, sir.

Wait. Why not have the whole wedding there? We'll do it on a Monday morning.

made from real gorilla chest
See this sweater? There's no better
than authentic Irish Setter
See this hat? 'Twas my cat
My evening wear, vampire bat
These white slippers are albino
African endangered rhino
Grizzle-bear underwear
Turtle's necks I've got my share
Beret of poodle on my noodle it shall rest
Try my red robin suit,
it comes one breast or two
See my vest, see my vest,
See my vest
Like my loafers? Former gophers
It was that or skin my chauffeurs
But a greyhound-fur tuxedo would be best
So, let's prepare these dogs

Marge: I'd be thrilled. You can start right now.
Bart: [angry] D'oh!
Marge: And I'm going to keep teaching your class, like it or lump it.
Bart: Well, then, I guess I'll just have to get into the crawlspace again.

class and runs off in the crawlspace to hide from her]

birds...

punishment. [grabs Bart, then reaches back for Milhouse] You too, snitchy.

Reverend Lovejoy: For your punishment you are going to clean every one of the 
pipes of the pipe organ which you have befouled with your music.

Milhouse: Sorry about that Bart, but I did not want birds eating my soul.

Scientist: Uhhh...
Troy McClure: He'll tell you that in nature one creature invariably eats 
another to survive. Don't kid yourself, Jimmy. If a cow ever got the chance, 
he'd eat you and everyone you care about!

Homer: [ringing bell] Hear ye, hear ye! Ye olde town crier proclaimed crappy by 
all! Chooseth Homer Simpson, and he shalt rock thy world!
Chief Wiggum: My God, he is fabulous!
Principal Skinner: He's embiggened that role with his cromulent performance.

Homer: Here are your messages: "You have 30 minutes to move your car," "You 
have 10 minutes," "Your car has been impounded," "Your car has been crushed 
into a cube," "You have 30 minutes to move your cube."

Homer: [answering] Hello, Mr. Burns' office.
Mr. Burns: Is it about my cube?
%
Smithers: Montgomery Burns' office. Oh hello, Mrs Burns. I'll see if your son 
is available.
Homer: Mr Burns has a mother? She must be 100 million years old!
Smithers: [to Homer] She has limited capacities. All she can do is dial and 
yell. [talks back to Mrs Burns] I'm sorry, Monty can't come to the phone right 
now. He's in a very important meeting and can't be disturbed. [shot of Burns 
trying to avoid falling asleep] Uh-huh... okay, I'll give him the message. 
[hangs up] Mr Burns can't stand talking to his mother. He never forgave her for 
having that affair with President Taft.
Homer: [chuckling] Taft, you old dog!

Marge: Is there something wrong, Homie?
Homer: No.
Marge: Except?
Homer: Except... I killed Mr. Burns!
Lisa: What happened, Dad?
Homer: I punched Burns right in his 104-year-old face!

Homer uses a fire extinguisher to quench the blaze in Mr. Burns office, which 
miraculously suffers no fire damage, nor is Mr. Burns even aware he was trapped 
in a fire
Mr. Burns: Good Lord Smithers, you look attrocious! I thought I told you to 
take a vacation.
Homer: Uh, Smithers already left, sir. I am his replacement, Homer Simpson.
Mr. Burns: Simpson, eh? Ah yes, I will have my lunch now. A single pillow of 
shredded wheat, some steamed toast, and a dodo egg.
Homer: But I think the dodo went extinct.
Mr. Burns: Get going! And after lunch install a computer system and rotate my 
office so the window faces the hills!

Chester: He didn't create Itchy: I did.
Bart: Huh?
Chester: He stole the character from me in 1928. When I complained, his thugs 
kicked me out of his office, and dropped an anvil on me. Luckily, I was 
carrying an umbrella at the time.

[Watching "Amendment To Be", which has replaced "Itchy & Scratchy".]
Bart: What the hell is this?
Lisa: It's one of those campy '70s throwbacks that appeals to Generation X'ers.
Bart: We need another Vietnam to thin out their ranks a little!
%
Roger Myers, Jr.: Okay, maybe my dad did steal Itchy. But so what? Animation is 
built on plagiarism. If it werenâ€™t for someone plagiarizing The Honeymooners 
we wouldnâ€™t have The Flintstones. If someone hadnâ€™t ripped off Sergeant 
Bilko, thereâ€™d be no Top Cat. Huckleberry Hound, Chief Wiggum (Chief Wiggum 
stares at Roger Meyers), Yogi Bear, hah! Andy Griffith, Edward G. Robinson, Art 
Carney. Your Honor, you take away our right to steal ideas, where are they 
gonna come from? (points to Marge in the galley): Her?

Medieval. Starring Dyan Cannon and Troy McClure.
Kermit the Frog: Foul villian, unhand that woman!
Miss Piggy: Quiet, frog!
Bart: What is a Muppet?
Homer{chuckling}: It is not quite a mop, and it is not a pet! To tell the 
truth, I don't know.
Troy McClure{as black knight}: Oh princess fair, wilst thou grant thee thine 
dainty hoof in marriage?
Bart: Hey, who is that leathery muppet?
Marge: He is not a Muppet. That is Troy McClure. Back in the 1970s he was quite 
the teen heartthrob.
Homer: Troy McClure? That guy's a freak!
Marge: What are you talking about?
Homer: You know, his bizarre personal life. Those weird things they say he does 
down at the aquarium. Why, I heard...
Marge: Oh, Homer, that's just an urban legend. People don't do that kind of 
thing with fish!

Louie: Troy McClure!? You said he was dead!
Fat Tony: No, what I said is that he sleeps with the fishes! You see...

your butt and mail you to Iran!

Homer: [after Lisa tells him about Bart's problem; his face turns a weird shade 
of red and he is unnervingly calm] Yes... that's a real pickle. Would you 
excuse me for a moment?
[He turns to the wall, puts on a radiation suit hood and screams out muffled 
obscenities, then removes the hood and turns to face Lisa, eerily calm again.]
Homer: All right, I have thought this through. I will send Bart the money to 
fly home. Then I will murder him.

kindly be square.

violating U.S. law.

Homer: Please identify this object.
Apu: It appears to be the flag that disappeared from the public library last 
year.
Homer: Correct. Now, we all know the thirteen stripes are for good luck, but 
why does the American flag have precisely forty-seven stars?
Apu: Because this particular flag is [chuckling] ridiculously out of date! The 
library must have purchased it during the brief period in 1912 after New Mexico 
became a state but before Arizona did.
Homer: Uh... partial credit.

Proctor: All right, here's your last question. What was the cause of the Civil 
War?

presence of pure evil, it was then I knew the option was to separate you two 
immediately. [from the past] You both need to sign these. [voiceover from the 
present] But what to do with poor Hugo? Too crazy for Boy's Town; too much of a 
boy for Crazy Town. The child was an outcast. [Back in the present.] So we did 
the only humane thing.

[Ned's poorly built, new house collapses.]
Homer: Aw, shoot. [Ned sighes and cleans his glasses. A lens snaps off, and Ned 
sighes again, and puts them on.]
Ned: Calm down, Nedilly-diddly-diddly-diddly-doodly, they did their best, 
shodilly-iddly-iddly-diddly. Gotta be nice, hostiddly-iddly-diddly-diddly... 
Aw, hell-diddly-ding-dong-crap! CAN'T YOU MORONS DO ANYTHING RIGHT?!!!! 
[everyone gasps]
Krusty: Hey!
Marge: Ned, we meant well. And everyone here tried their best.
Ned: Well, my family and I can't live in good intentions, Marge! Oh, your 
family's out of control, but we can't blame you, because you have gooood 
intentions.
Bart: Hey, back off, man!
Ned: Ooh, okay, dude, I wouldn't want you to have a cow, man. Here's a 
catchphrase you better learn for your adult years: "Hey, buddy, got a quarter?" 
[everyone gasps again]
Bart: I am shocked and appalled.
Lisa: Mr. Flanders, with all due respect, Bart didn't do anything.
Ned: [gasps sarcastically] Do I hear the sound of butting in? That's gotta be 
little Lisa Simpson, Springfield's answer to a QUESTION NO ONE ASKED! [Chief 
Wiggum laughs] What do we have here? [he shakes Chief Wiggum's belly] The long, 
flabby arm of the law? The last case you got to the bottom of was a case of the 
mallowmars!
Krusty: [writing in a notebook] Mallowmars, oh, that's going in the act.
Ned: Oh, yeah, the clown. The only one of you buffoons who doesn't make me 
laugh. [to Lenny] And as for you, I don't know you but I'm sure you're a jerk!
Lenny: Hey, I've only been here a few minutes, what's going on?
Ned: [to Moe] You ugly, hate-filled man!
Moe: Hey, hey, I may be ugly and hate-filled, but I... Um, what was the third 
thing you said? [Ned walks over to Homer, who smiles nervously]
Ned: [calmly and coldly] Homer... you are the worst human being I have ever met.
Homer: Hey, I got off pretty easy.

Jay Sherman: It stinks! It stinks! It stinks!
Doctor: Yes, Mr. Sherman, everything stinks.

Dr. Foster: The only problem with the treatment was that it worked too well. 
You became unable to express any anger at all. From that point on, any time you 
felt angry, you could only respond with a string of nonsensical jabbering.
Ned: Well, I'll be darn-diddly-aren't.
Dr. Foster: That's the stuff. You suppressed your rage for so long, it finally 
erupted as a massive public explosion.

Bart: [sees Homer's figure in the lighthouse light] Hey Lise! Is that dad?

[Homer lies on a sofa, talking to a well-dressed man.]
Homer: I always just figured my wife was my soulmate. But if it's not Marge, 
then who is it? Where do I begin looking?
Man: This really goes beyond my training as a furniture salesman, sir. Now if 
you don't want the sofa, I'll have to ask you to leave.

Leonard Nimoy: Hello. I'm Leonard Nimoy. The following tale of alien encounters 
is true. And by true, I mean false. It's all lies. But they're entertaining 
lies. And in the end, isn't that the real truth? The answer is no. Now our 
story begins on a Friday morning in a little town called Springfield...

[Homer sees the "alien" in the woods for the first time
Homer: [whimpers in fear] Please! Don't hurt me!
Alien: Don't be afraid...

tall grass, spelling out "Yahhh!" as he does so]
%
Homer: This Friday, we're going back to the woods and we're going to find that 
alien!
Bart: What if we don't?
Homer: We'll fake it, and sell it to the Fox network.
Bart: [chuckles] They'll buy anything.
Homer: Now son, they do a lot of quality programming, too.
[After a short pause, they both burst into laughter.]
Homer: I kill me.

Wiseguy: Sorry, Donkey Kong, you're just not a draw anymore.

Squeaky-Voiced Teen: I don't think he's coming back.

[Marge has decided to go into the pretzel business.]
Marge: What's my territory?
Frank Ormand: Your territory? Well, let me put it this way: wherever a young 
mother is ignorant as to what to feed her baby, you'll be there. Wherever nacho 
penetration is less than total, you'll be there. Wherever a Bavarian is not 
quite full, you'll be there.
Marge: Don't forget fat people, they can't stop eating.
Homer: (passing by) Hey, pretzels.
%
(Fat Tony has just destroyed Hans Moleman's hot dog stand)
Tony: This is a pretzel town, pretty boy.
%
Tony: Sorry we're late. Can we have the money now?
Marge: The answer is no.
Tony: I'm afraid I must insist. You see, my wife, she has been most vocal on 
the subject of the pretzel monies. "Where's the money? When are you going to 
get the money? Why aren't you getting the money now?" And so on. So, please, 
the money.
%
[Marge arrives at the school loading zone. An unshaven and ragged Skinner 
appears]
Marge: Are you sure the children will get enough nutrition from these pretzels?
Skinner: [monotonous] Yes I am sure. [a bandaged hand gives Marge money] Sure 
as sure can be.
Marge: Oh my God. What happened to your fingers?
Legs: [off-camera] Boating accident.
Skinner: I believe it was a... boaking accident. [a laser sight is aimed at his 
temple] I have to go now.
%
Homer: (Gasp) You mean the mob only did me a favor to get something in return? 
(Disappointed) Fat Tony! I will bid good day to you sir!
Fat Tony: Okay...I will go (exits the building)...Hey...wait a minute!

Marge: Homer, did you tell the mob they could eliminate my competition with 
savage beatings and attempted murders?
Homer: In those words? Yes.
%
Homer: So, Burns is gonna make us all go on a stupid corporate retreat up in 
the mountains to learn about teamwork. Which means we'll have to cancel our 
plans to hang around here.
Bart: Teamwork is overrated.
Homer: Huh?
Bart: Think about it. I mean, what team was Babe Ruth on? Who knows.
Lisa/Marge: Yankees.
Bart: Sharing is a bunch of bull, too. And helping others. And what's all this 
crap I've been hearing about tolerance?
Homer: Hmm. Your ideas are intriguing to me and I wish to subscribe to your 
newsletter. But I think we have to go to the retreat anyway.
%
Burns: Ah sitting, the great leveler. From the lowliest peasant to the mightest 
pharoah, who does not enjoy a good sit?
Homer: Oh, man, you are so right. Did you ever sit like this?
Mr. Burns: Yes, yes, that's it. Oh, I could go for one of those right now. Ahh! 
The only hard part is getting up.
Homer: He-he. Why get up? Here's a little move I have been tinkering with. Say 
I wanted that bowl of dip.
Mr. Burns: Why, you'd have to get up.
Homer: Oh?
[Homer pounds table, which causes bowl to leap several times until it comes 
into Homer's hand]
Mr. Burns: Sir, I am in your debt.
Homer: Use it wisely, my friend.

Kearney (to Homer): Thanks. Hey, where do ya keep the liquor?
Homer: I hide a bottle of Schnapps in the baby's crib.

Kearney (walks away, muttering): Tellin' me, ya blue-haired witch.
Marge: I heard that!

Shary: [drunk] Wasted away again in Margaritaville
Barney: Searching for my lost shaker of salt â€“ oh, here it is.

Doug: Uh question for Ms. Bellamy. In episode 2F09*, when Itchy plays 
Scratchy's skeleton like a xylophone, he strikes the same rib twice in 
succession, yet he produces two clearly different tones. I mean, what are we to 
believe, that this is some sort of a... [the nerds chuckle] a magic xylophone 
or something? Gee, I really hope somebody got fired for that blunder.
June: Uh, well, uh...
Homer: I'll field this one. Let me ask you a question. Why would a man whose 
shirt says "Genius at Work" spend all of his time watching a children's cartoon 
show?
Doug: [embarrassed pause] I withdraw my question. [starts eating a candy bar]
%
2F09 is actually the production code for the season six Simpsons episode "Homer 
the Great"
Bart: It's back to the basics: classic Itchy & Scratchy.
Lisa: We should thank our lucky stars that they're still putting on a program 
of this caliber after so many years.
(The Simpson kids smile, then frown and immediately become bored with what 
they're watching)
Bart: What else is on?
[Lisa changes the channel. The screen changes to static as the producer credits 
appear.]

June Bellamy: Relax, Homer. You'll do fine. I'm June Bellamy. I do the voices 
of Itchy & Scratchy.
Homer: You? But you're a lady.
June: [mimicking Itchy] She's a lady, all right. [mimicking Scratchy] A 
beautiful lady.
Homer: [laughing] Hey, that really is you. How did you get to be so good?
June: Oh, just experience, I suppose. I started out as Road Runner. [mimicking 
The Road Runner] Meep!
Homer: You mean "Meep, meep"?
June: No, they only paid me to say it once, then they doubled it on the 
soundtrack. Cheap bastards.

John: Homer, what have you got against gays?
Homer: You know, it's not...usual! If there was a law, it would be against it!
Marge: Oh, please, Homer, you're embarrassing yourself!
Homer: No, they're embarrassing me! They're embarrassing America! They turned 
the Navy into a floating joke. They took our best names, like Bruce, Lance, and 
Julian. Those used to be our toughest, manliest names, but now they're just...
John: Queer?
Homer: And that's another thing â€” I resent you people using that word. That's 
our word for making fun of you! We need it!
%
Homer: Marge, the boy was wearing a Hawaiian shirt.
Marge: So?
Homer: Thereâ€™s only two kind of guys who wear those shirts: gay guys and big, 
fat party animals. And Bart doesnâ€™t look like a big, fat party animal to me.
Marge: So, if you wore a Hawaiian shirt, it wouldnâ€™t be gay?

Steel Mill Worker #1: Stand still, there's a spark in you hair!
Steel Mill Worker #2: Get it, get it!
Steel Mill Worker #3: [walks past Homer holding a vat of hot steel in hot 
pants] Hot stuff, comin' through!

Homer: [sobbing] I don't know! This is a NIGHTMARE! YOU'RE ALL SICK!
Steel Mill Worker #4: Oh be nice!

Homer: ...And the entire steel mill was gay.
Moe: Pfft, where you been, Homer? Entire steel industry's gay. Yeah, aerospace 
too. And the railroads! And you know what else? Broadway!

Cecil: Now make yourself at home. Perhaps a glass of Bordeaux? I have the '82 
ChÃ¢teau Latour and a rather indifferent Rausan-SÃ©gla.

like orange drink fermented under a radiator.
Cecil: That would be the Latour, then.

Sideshow Bob: You wanted to be Krusty's sidekick since you were five! What

Cecil: I'll thank you not to refer to Princeton that way.

Lisa: Oh, it's hopeless, utterly, utterly hopeless!

enough, but when Cecil tries to kill you, [mockingly] "it's hopeless, utterly, 
utterly hopeless!"

Cecil: Maris?

Chief Wiggum: Bye, Lisa. If anything goes wrong, just dial 911. Uh, unless it's

crap.

Ned: Homer, I've got a Fozzie of a bear of a problem! See, Maude and her mother 
were visiting Tyre and Sidon, the twin cities of the Holy Land. Well, they must 
have kneeled in the wrong place and prayed to the wrong god because they're 
being held prisoner by militants of some sort!
Homer: Militants, eh? Well if I were you, I'd kick their asses.
Ned: Well anywhodilly-doodle, the police say it's just a routine 
hostage-taking, but I gotta drive to Capitol City and fill out some forms to 
get them out. Could you possibly watch the kids tonight?
Homer: Oh, gee, I'd really love to wanna help you, Flanders but...Marge 
was...taken prisoner in the....Holy Land, and...
Lisa: (tugging at Homer's hand) I'll do it! I'll babysit!
Ned: I dunno, Lisa. You're awfully young and the boys can be quite a handful. 
Todd's been pinching everyone lately!
Lisa: But I'm smart and responsible and my parents will be right next door!

Flanders.]
Rex Banner: Are you the Beer Baron?
Ned: Well, if you're talking about root beer, I plead guil-diddly-ilty as 
char-diddly-arged.
Rex Banner: (To Eddie and Lou) He's not the Baron. But he sounds drunk. Bring 
him in!
[Next, he grabs Comic Book Guy]
Rex Banner: Are you the Baron?
Comic Book Guy: Yes, but only by night. By day, I'm a mild-mannered reporter 
for a major metropolitan newspaper.
Rex Banner: Don't crack wise with me, tubby!
Comic Book Guy: "Tubby?" (looking at his ample gut) Oh, yes. "Tubby."

barley and sour mash.]

past!

[Bart has seen Principal Skinner and Mrs. Krabappel kissing.]
Skinner: Now, Bart...son...I don't know what you think you saw but let me 
assure you that...
Mrs. Krabappel: What Seymour..I mean, what Principal Skinner means, Bart, is 
that sometimes a little boy's imagination can run away with him!
Bart: That's the best you can do? You could have at least said you were giving 
her CPR or rehearsing a play!
Skinner: Is it...too late to say that?
Bart: Mmm-hmm!
%
Homer: Wait a minute. Bart's teacher's name is Krabappel? I've been calling her 
Crandall. Why didn't someone tell me? I've been making an idiot out of myself!

Ralph: Mrs. Krabappel and Principal Skinner were in the closet making babies 
and I saw one of the babies and then the baby looked at me.
%
Agnes: [to Bart, who is keeping her busy whilst Seymour and Edna sneak out] I 
collect pictures of wedding cakes from different periods. (She opens a book 
containing photographs of cakes) It all started in 1969 when Good Housekeeping 
featured a picture of a lovely cake.
Bart: You wouldn't happen to have any real cakes around here, would you?
Agnes: Oh my, no. Don't care for cake, too sweet. (points at a cake) Now, this 
is called a Lady Baltimore cake. At my age, I don't have that much saliva left, 
so you'll have to lick my thumb before I turn the page.
Bart: Aw, can't I just turn the page for you?
Agnes: [slaps his hand away, harsher] No! [sweetly] But you can pick out any 
picture you want to take home with you.
Bart: Erm...O.K. I'll take...that one.
Agnes: [slaps his hand away] NO!
Bart: Aah! What the-
Agnes: You can't have that one: that's a coconut cake!

Maude: Excuse me, Edna, I don't think we're talking about love here! We're

Reverend Lovejoy: Mmm, yes, I remember Satan's Little Helper...littering the 
rectory with his dirt, biting me in the apse.
Agnes: (yells angrily) He unholied the holy water!
Bart: That's him, all right. I'll be happy to take him off your hands.
Reverend: Oh, I'm afraid that's impossible, Bart. He's no longer among us.
Bart (gasps in terror): You didn't crucify him?
Reverend (hearty laugh): No, he's safely with one of our parishioners. I'll 
give you his address if you like.
Agnes: And then buy something or get out! [Rev. Lovejoy gives her an angry 
look.] Angel.

Mr. Burns: I'll keep it short and sweet. Family, religion, friendship. These 
are the three demons you must slay if you wish to succeed in business. When 
opportunity knocks, you don't wanna be driving to the maternity hospital or 
sitting in some phoney-baloney church, or [finger quotes] "synagogue". 
Questions?
[somewhat long pause, finally Skinner raises his hand]"
Principal Skinner: Well, uh, I'm gonna take advantage of this rare opportunity 
even if you children aren't interested. Which do you think is more important? 
Hard work, or stick-to-itiveness?
Mr. Burns: Are there any real questions?
Lisa: Yes. Does your plant have a recycling program?
Mr. Burns: "Re-cy-cling"? [He turns his mental dictionary to "R", and searches 
but doesn't find "recycle" anywhere] I'm afraid I'm not familiar with that 
term, you adorable little ragamuffin.
Lisa: You never heard of recycling? It means to reuse things to conserve our 
natural resources.
Mr. Burns: Oh, so Mother Nature needs a favor?! Well, maybe she should have 
thought of that when she was besetting us with droughts and floods and poison 
monkeys! Nature started the fight for survival, and now she wants to quit 
because she's losing?! Well, I say, hard cheese.

Kent Brockman: Remember C. Montgomery Burns? The man who blocked out our sun, 
ran over a local boy, and stole Christmas from 1981 to 1985 inclusive. Well,

Homer: [watching television in the living room] Please be Flanders. Please be

Akira: Ah, yes. This is a product called Mr. Sparkle, very popular dish 
detergent. [points at the mascot on the box] Hey, he looks like you! [laughs]
Lisa: What's he saying?
Akira: He identifies himself as a magnet for foodstuffs. He boasts that he will 
banish dirt to the land of wind and ghosts.

sacred forest of Hokkaid&#333;, renowned for its countless soap factories.

Reverend Lovejoy: [regaling his congregation of his fight with the monkeys at 
the zoo] Baboons to the left of me. Baboons to the right. The speeding 
locomotive tore through a sea of inhuman fangs. A pair of the great apes rose

third came screaming at me! [imitates hissing baboon][quietly resolved] ... and 
that's when I got mad.

Grimes: No, a 5-13, in your procedures manual? A 5-13?
[Homer glances at his watch again]
Grimes: [points] Look at your control panel!
Homer: Oh, a five thir-teen. I'll handle it.

his console, shorting it out and silencing the alarms]
Homer: That got it.
[Grimes looks on in horror]
%
Homer: Hi, Grimey old buddy!
Grimes: I'm not your buddy, Simpson. I don't like you. In fact, I hate you! 
Stay the hell away from me, because from now on, we're enemies!
Homer: [haltingly] Okay... Do I have to do anything?
%
Homer: Oh, I canâ€™t believe it. I got an enemy. Me, the most beloved man in 
Springfield.
Moe: Ah, it's a weird world, Homer. As hard as it is to believe, some people 
don't care for me, neither.
Homer: No, I won't accept that.
Moe: No, it's true. I got their names written down right here on what I call 
my, uh, "enemies list." [reaches under the bar for a sheet of paper]
Barney: [takes list and reads it] Jane Fonda, Daniel Schorr, Jack Anderson... 
Hey! This is Richard Nixon's enemies list! You just crossed out his name and 
put yours!
Moe: Okay, gimme that, gimme it back. [takes list and writes] Barney Gumble.
Barney: Aw...

Smithers: Our first little genius is Ralph Wiggum.

Smithers: [chuckles indulgently] It's pretty good, sir.
Mr. Burns: Hot tub? Media room? It's supposed to be a power plant! Not Anne 
Bueller's bordello! Thank you, get out. Next!

[Martin walks on-stage with his impressive power plant model]
Martin: Behold! The power plant of the future...today!
Mr. Burns: Ugh! Too cold and sterile. Where's the heart?
Martin: But it really generates power. It's lighting this room right now!
[Martin turns a knob on the model and dims the lights]
Mr. Burns: You lose, get off my property!

[Homer wins the children's nuclear power plant model contest, and everyone 
cheers. For Grimes, this is the last straw...]
Grimes: I can't stand it any longer! This whole plant is insane! Insane, I tell 
you! [snaps mentally] Daagh! Aagh!
[He runs out into the corridor]
Grimes: I can be lazy too! [yanks off his tie, and moons one of the employees] 
Look at me! I am a worthless employee, just like Homer Simpson! Give me a 
promotion!
[He pulls up his pants and waddles away, cross-eyed, like a penguin. He enters 
the break room and grabs two donuts from a donut box]
Grimes: Ooh, I eat like a slob, but nobody minds.
[Homer, Smithers and several other employees watch as Grimes scoffs down nearly 
all the donuts in the box, then runs into the men's bathroom]
Grimes: [from the bathroom] I'm peeing on the seat. Give me a raise! [comes out 
of the bathroom and waves his hands in Homer's face] Now I'm returning to work 
without washing my hands. But it doesn't matter, because I'm Homer Simpson!
[He runs into Homer's work station and spins around in the chair]
Grimes: I don't need to do my work, 'cause someone else will do it for me. 
[puts his feet up, and smacks himself on the forehead] D'oh, d'oh, d'oh!
Homer: Hey, you okay, Grimey?
Grimes: [getting up] I'm better than okay. I'm Homer Simpson.
Homer: [chuckles] You wish.
Grimes: [noticing Mr Burns] Oh, hi, Mr Burns. I'm the worst worker in the 
world. Time to go home to my mansion and eat my lobster.

Wiggum: If it isn't my old friends from Springfield, the Simpsons! What brings 
you folks to New Orleans?
Bart: Mardi Gras, man. When the Big Easy calls, you gotta accept the charges.
Lisa: Chief Wiggum, I can't wait to hear about all the exciting, sexy 
adventures you're sure to have against this colorful backdrop.
Wiggum: Well golly, I'd love to chat, but my son's been kidnapped. You haven't 
seen him, have you? Caucasian male, between the ages of six and ten, thinning 
hair.
Homer: [points to Ralph and Big Daddy] Over there.
Ralph: [points to Chief Wiggum] Look Big Daddy, it's regular Daddy.
Big Daddy: The chief! Oh, I suppose I'd best to run. Lord have mercy, I wish I 
weren't so fat.

Ralph: [to Chief Wiggum] Daddy, when I grow up, I wanna be just like you.

Chief Wiggum: Start eating?
Ralph: I didn't mean it that way.

Homer: [over feedback from the massive sound wave unleashed on the town] You 
really did it this time, Bart! You're in for the punishment of a lifetime!

Cadet #1: I'm glad we snuck into town. That was some GOOD corn!

Firing range Instructor: Since you attended public school, I'm gonna assume 
you're already proficient with small arms, so we're gonna start you with 
something a little more advanced. [hands Bart a MGL]
Bart: Ho-ho, baby! [Bart fires off five grenades. Four hit the targets, but the 
fifth flies off into the distance]
Firing range instructor: Four out of five, Simpson, impressive, but you missed 
your last target.
Bart: [slyly] Did I?

smoking crater where his car used to be. Nelson watches in the background from 
the classroom window]
Nelson: Ha-ha!

Commandant: Traditionally, the academy tested these virtues by pitting you

Moe: Yeah, alright, listen up, guys, the Springfield Police have told me that 
91% of all traffic accidents are caused by you six guys.

drivers. [the regulars moan and groan] We'll choose the same way they pick the 
Pope. [sets a giant glass jar with pickled eggs floating in it on the table] 
Everybody reach in and draw a pickled egg. Whoever gets the black egg stays

Bart: Excuse me, is this Mad Magazine?
Woman: No, it's Mademoiselle. We're buying our sign on the installment plan.

Woman: Listen, kid, you probably think lots of crazy stuff goes on in there, 
but this is just a place of business.
Bart: Oh... okay.

Bart: Wow! I will never wash these eyes again.

Armin: My mind is made up! I'm not coming back and that's final!
Edna: Oh, Seymour.
Armin: And I'm not Seymour, my name is Armin! This is Armin's apartment, 
Armin's liquor, Armin's copy of "Swank", Armin's frozen peas.
Homer: Can I see your copy of "Swank", Armin?
Armin: Yes, you can. This is Armin's life, and maybe it's not perfect, but at 
least I'm back where I belong. I was born a no-goodnik, and I'll die a 
no-goodnik.
Agnes: Seymour! I didn't bring you up to use language like that!
Armin: Well, you didn't bring me up at all!
Agnes: To hell I didn't! I've been taking care of you for twenty-six years! I'm 
the only mother you've ever known!
Armin: But you have your real son!
Agnes: You are my real son! You've been my son longer than he has, and he 
doesn't need me, and I don't need him! Now you march yourself downstairs and 
get in that car!
Armin: Yes, Mother.
Agnes: And the rest of you, too!
All: Yes, Mrs. Skinner.

she stews in anger in the grocery store check-out lane.]
Marge: Good morning, Agnes. Mmm...how's your new son working out?
Agnes: That child is the most disobedient, smart-alecky middle-aged man in 
creation!
Edna: Hello, ladies. Is this the line for people who want to bad-mouth Sergeant 
Skinner?
Marge: And have ten items or less.
Edna:[discarding items] Twelve, eleven, ten, the man's a weenie!
Marge: Now be fair, Edna. I liked Armin Tamzarian too, but he was at least as 
big a weenie as Sergeant Skinner.
Edna: But he was "our" weenie!

Ralph: Bart's my bestest boyfriend.

Homer (to Marge): Oh, what's the big deal? Bart didn't like his presents. So 
what? It's not like he gives us such great gifts. Remember that maple leaf 
ironed between the sheets of wax paper? What was that? That was crap.
Marge: It's not just the presents. The kids don't appreciate me anymore. They'd 
rather hang out with their friends than with their mom.
Homer: So they're growing up. Soon, they'll be leaving the nest, and you'll 
have time for yourself. Hundreds of thousands of hours. And then the peace of 
the grave.

Marge: You know Chloe some of us stayed in this town and made it a better place.
Homer: Oh come on Marge, the only reason we don't move out of this dung hill is 
because of my court ordered ankle bracelet. (Reveals a beeping bracelet on his 
right ankle) I'm here! I'm here! Quit bugging me.
Marge: Why do you always have to show that to company?
Homer: It's a conversation starter. (short pause)

from G. Gordon Liddy!
Marge: I'm so sick of names!

when your mom has half a glass of wine, she goes cuckoo bananas.

Bart: Thinking is for losers!

Lisa: Be careful, Mom! There's hot lava under the ground!
Chloe: Actually, when it's underground, lava is called magma!
Lisa: You're so smart, Chloe!
Chloe: Walter Cronkite told me the same thing.

Chloe: Lisa! What are you doing in there?

him]
Homer: Boy, push down on the bumper! Then I can back the car up and save myself!
Bart: [suspicious] If I save you, what are you going to do to me?
Homer: [calmy] Shower you with love, because this experience has taught me just 
how precious you are! [Bart pushes down on the bumper, at which point Homer 
goes berserk] I'll kill you, I'll kill your whole family!

Homer: [calmly] Kidding! I'm kidding! We can do that, we have a special

and now we're in Nevada State Prison. Also, I don't know where Bart is. If you

Marge: Where's Bart? I haven't seen him since you came home.
Homer: (Sarcastically) Oh, you haven't seen Bart for a few hours, so you 
automatically assume I let something terrible happen.
Marge: I didn't say that.
Homer: (still sarcastic) I know what you think... when stupid Homer wasn't 
looking, Bart got kidnapped by a monkey.
Marge: (concerned) I could never think of something that horrible!
Homer: (still sarcastic) And now I'm using sarcasm to confess the whole thing, 
so later I can say that I already told you!
Marge: Sorry I asked. (leaves)
Lisa: Dad, you can't keep this up for long.
Homer: (still sarcastic) Oh, you're so right, I guess I should be more 
concerned with Bart's safety than covering my own butt! And maybe I'm talking

mer-man (shows the offending picture) I am dumping all your mail from home into 
the sea. (Willie does so) And I can assure you that there were cookies in

Skinner: Oh, no, of course not! Women are unique in every way.

Dr. Hibbert: It's hard to say. With retrograde amnesia such as this, the

Firefighter: Sir we've been here six times this month.

embarassed to admit it, so I set the house on fire. Feels good to tell the 
truth... no I'm lying again it feels bad.

Bart: What's that comin' out of the safe?

headlights, which focused on the cologne bottle, causing it to boil and soon 
explode.

Jack Bauer: [cocks pistol and aims at Bart's head] Bart Simpson, 12 minutes ago 
you made a very annoying prank phone call to me. All units move in! [Vehicles 
and soldiers move into the room from everywhere with guns aimed at Bart.] I 
pulled every single agent off of all other cases to track you down and bring 
you to justice. It was a tough decision but I think I made the right call.

You have what made America great: no understanding of the limits of your power

Sideshow Bob: A fitting epitaph (Pause) It means last words!
Bart: Are you here to teach me, or kill me?
%
Lisa: I finally found a place I belong.
Marge: Your week's up! Time to go home.
Lisa: [gasps] It can't be Saturday already! [checks camera] Monday was 
orientation. Tuesday, we did mime. Wednesday, we did Mame. Thursday, we got 
attacked by bees. Friday morning, Andrew Lloyd Webber and Elaine Stritch helped 
us make wallets. Friday evening, we performed Angels in America: A Gay Fantasia 
on National Themes. Part 1: Millennium Approaches. Part 2...
Marge: Perestroika?
Lisa: That's right! Strike the set, pizza party, Sunday morning and then-- 
[gasps] Nooooo!
Sarah: Goodbye Lisa! I'll miss you a lot! Then a little! Then not too much!

Bart: I already spent my money. I payed some idiot to walk up the down 
escalator all day. [scene cuts to Gil walking up the down escalator]

Bart: Fine, you can be our coach.
Lisa: Thanks. You can be the free safety.
Bart: Wrong sport.
Lisa: I mean, the point guard.
Bart: Also wrong.
Lisa: I'm gonna do a little research.
Bart: A little is not gonna be enough, honey pie.
Lisa: Don't call me "honey pie".
Bart: You got it, tootsie pop.
Lisa: [grunts]
Nelson: Get a room, you two.
Lisa: We're brother and sister.
Milhouse: So are my parents, I think.
%
Lisa: Bart, this guy has walked the last two batters, and if he walks you, we 
win the game. Don't swing at anything.
Bart: But I'm on a hot streak!
Lisa: Hot streaks are a statistical illusion!
Bart: I wish you were a statistical illusion.
Lisa: Well, there's a 97% chance I'm not, so do what I say!
%
Lisa: Managers manage, and players play.
Ralph: Do alligators alligate?
Lisa: I don't know! Yes!
Ralph: I'm scared!
%
Lisa: You made me love baseball. Not as a collection of numbers, but as an 
unpredictable, passionate game, beaten in excitement only by every other sport.
%
Bart Simpson: It's just a game. We're not really hurting anybody. [Accidentally 
hits Milhouse in the eye with controller]
Milhouse Van Houten: My non-lazy eye!

[Marge accidently hits Milhouse in the eye with her elbow]
Milhouse Van Houten: My other eye!

[After taking Lisa to the forest and carrying her up a tree, Edmund reveals his 
fangs]
Lisa Simpson: [gasps] You're a vampire! I should be scared, but I'm not.
Edmund: Let us move between the trees the way a bat does... by jumping!
%
Lisa Simpson: Edmund's almost here! So please, nobody be themselves.
Homer Simpson: I know, I know. Don't serve garlic, don't stab your guest in the 
heart with a wooden stake, don't ask him if he knows Frankenstein. It's racist 
somehow.
%
Edmund: [to Lisa] Sorry. My dad insisted on coming. [a bat appears and turns 
into Dracula] [clearly aggravated] Dad! I don't need a chaperone. I'm 400 years 
old.
Dracula: You live in my crypt, you play by my rules.
Edmund: You're tearing me apart!
%
Dracula: Look, I'm more than just a vampire. I'm a nut for dixieland jazz. 
[plays jazz trumpet]
Edmund: [rolls his eyes and groans] You said you weren't gonna bring that.
Dracula: I said I might not. [continues to play]
Edmund: [whispers to Lisa] They say vampires live forever, but I die of 
embarrassment every day.
Lisa: I know just how you feel.
[Cut to Homer dancing with Santa's Little Helper]
%
Lisa: Dad, can I talk to you for a second?
Homer: What is troubling you, my son? I mean, my girl son.
%
Homer: Sooner or later, everyone meets their Homer.

Homer: Just pick a dead end and chill out till you die.

Willie: [singing to the tune of Loch Lomond while waxing the floor] Oh, I'll 
wax the upstairs and I'll wax the downstairs and I'll get drunk in the library!

Lisa: [after seeing Cloisters Academy school bus] Lord Buddha, I know I'm not 
supposed to want stuff, but come on!
%
[Upon learning that Lisa doesn't want to be like her, Marge is upset and 
distraught.]
Marge: What's so wrong with me?
Homer: Nothing, sweetie, nothing! Let me explain. She doesn't want to turn out 
like you didn't... not until... diplomatic.... trapped... help. Remember 
nothing.
Marge: A mother will remember everything!
Homer: Well if you look inside your purse, you can find the 7 of clubs.
Marge:[Looks inside her purse and pulls out a photo of Lisa] No, it's a photo 
of Lisa who wants to be nothing like me.
%
Bart: What's your note say?
Lisa: The seven of clubs?
Homer:[Revealing himself to have put the 7 of clubs to cheer Lisa up] Tada!

Jeff Zucker: NBC, you are here to listen and not speak!

walks on his stubby bone feet through the plague-ridden streets of London...
Lisa: You said it was Boston.
Homer: [still in a creepy voice] Did I?
%
Nelson: My mom ran off with my birthday clown.
%
Bart: [to Raymond Bird] Now that you're officially my bird, let me fill you in 
on the pecking order around here. The top dog is me, followed by the top dog, 
the dog, then the cat and then you. But don't feel bad. You're ahead of 
Milhouse.
%
Milhouse: I thought your race car was a Transformer! Nothing's one thing 
anymore!

Santa Claus (Krusty): Kids never change; always dumb as potatoes.
%
Agnes Skinner: Hey, Simpson! How come you ain't in combat like a real man?
Homer: I'm too fat to fit in a foxhole.
%
Homer: Kids, remember when I promised to feed us from that victory garden? 
Well, instead, I grew this tree!
Lisa: Don't dare bring that thing in here!
Homer: What? You don't want a Christmas tree? That's crazy! Next you won't want 
a Christmas ham!
Lisa: Don't worry about that. I love meat and I always will. [takes a bite out 
of a slice of ham] Mmm-mm! That is some sweet pig meat!

[Homer's stint as a Mob informant has indirectly led to Fat Tony's death]
FBI agent: Homer, I just want you to know that, out of all the informants the 
FBI has ever had, you were the snitchiest.
Homer: [bitterly] Oh, I see. You use me to kill a man, and all I get is a 
handshake and a blanket!
FBI agent: I never shook your hand.
Other FBI agent: And we never said you could have the blanket. [takes the 
blanket away]
%
[Homer is talking with "Fit Tony", Fat Tony's cousin]
Fit Tony: I keep my friends close...
Homer: But your enemies closer?
Fit Tony: No! Why would I do that? If I kept my enemies close, they would kill 
me!
%
Bart: All right, Comic Book Guy, tell me my origin story.
Comic Book Guy: I will not relive that horror of that day! The answer is no, 
and I can say it in Na'vi or Klingon, which are pretty much the same. I have 
some theories on that, which I will share with you never.
Zack: It was the fourth-graders.
%
Apu: And America has so many enemies. Iran, Iraq, China, Mordor, the hoochies 
that laid low Tiger Woods, undesirable immigrants - by which I mean everyone 
that came after me, including my children...

Bart: I don't know. Can I really betray my country? I say the Pledge of 
Allegiance every day.
Chinese Agent: You pledge allegiance to the flag. And the flag is made in China.

Bart: I just have one question about hair: where does mine start? Head, head, 
head, hair! Where's the border?!

Moe: Excuse me, is this the seminar where you learn to pick up free escorts.
Chalmers: Well, we're not learning how to fold cloth napkins.
Ned Flanders: Well, I got excited for nothing.

Lisa: I find your decision to go back to blue empowering.
Marge: I thought you found my decision to go from blue to gray empowering.
Lisa: As a feminist virtually everything a woman does is empowering.

Ralph: Grandma had hair like that when she went to sleep in her forever-box.

Homer: Have you noticed how pizzas have gotten so small.
Woman: I know, they are like dimes.

Paddy: So it's true, your hair committed blue-icide.

Homer: Uh-oh, usually when it gets this quiet, Mr. Burns is standing behind me.
Mr. Burns: Actually, I'm standing in front of you.
Bart: That's Angry Dad, the semi-autobiographical web cartoon I created.
Homer: I legally forced him to say "semi".

Skinner: Now, remember to stay hydrated, and... [rattling noise is heard] AAH! 
Rattle snake! [it's shown that it's just Bart with a rattle; he laughs]
Chalmers: Hah! You fall for that every year, Seymour.
Skinner: In one year I didn't, and I was bitten by an actual rattle snake.
Chalmers: Yes, and if I recall, you took a sick day you did not have.
Skinner: But I was gonna lose my foot!
Chalmers: Of which you have two.

Lisa: These flowers saved me from a terrible fate: not getting an A on my next 
science project!

Homer: [to Lisa] If you were a boy, you'd be a scientist!

Abe: What did you do during the war?
Walter Hotenhoffer: World War II? I wasn't born yet!
Abe: It's funny how many Germans say that these days.
%
Bart: It's like we've got our own monster!
Homer: Your grandfather is not a monster! Now, let's chain him in the basement 
until the circus comes to town.
Abe: Sounds good!
%
Abe: Together, we survived the Depression, won a few wars and put a man on the 
moon. In fact, the only mistake our generation made, was creating that 
generation! [points at Homer, Lenny and Carl dancing around Homer's burning car]

Boy: I can see why they call you the "Great Simpsina".

Lisa: This is our house. There's nothing buried here but hopes and dreams.

Lisa: Bart, I haven't been selling the truffles. I have been eating them.
Bart: Really? Why?
Lisa: Vegetarian food is so boring! Pasta! Soy! You know what's a bad pizza 
topping? Broccoli!

[both Marge and Homer are drunk]
Marge: Now, which is our room again?
Homer: You know. It had that painting of that lady and that monster on the 
ceiling.
Marge: That was a mirror!
%
Lisa: Okay, first of all, it's never wise to use the word "spew" in a love song.
%
Lisa: Why would a popular fifth grader like Taffy be interested in a Milhouse 
like Milhouse?
Bart: I dunno. It's one of those mysteries, like how do my clothes get clean, 
and put back in my drawers?
%
Lisa: Taffy's up to something, and I won't find out what it is sitting on a 
computer. It's time to get boots on the ground! [cut to Lisa putting 
flower-patterned boots to her feet] [sweetly] You like my boots?
Bart: Once you get past the sister ick, they're fine.

Milhouse: You don't want me to be with you, you don't want me to be with 
someone else. How miserable do I have to be before you're happy?
Lisa: Milhouse, I...I...oh. [Lisa kisses Milhouse]
Milhouse: Lisa, does this mean you like me?
Lisa: Yes. No! I don't know! It means that life is full of unexpected things

faints and falls off the cliff. A bald eagle flies up with Milhouse on its back]

Lisa: What's this key with the plastic skull for?
Bart: That's for my box with the real skull.

Lisa: So how come we have all these other keys?
Homer: Well, if you live long enough, you'll start to accumulate things. This 
is from a gas station's men's room. They put a block of wood on it so you don't 
walk away with it.

Lisa: I've discovered a mystery wrapped in a riddle in the basement of a lousy 
school!

pour it out and toss the bucket back up? Don't drink it!

Chalmers: Skinner! When I say "drive us to Bolivia", that is your cue to start 
the damn car!

cake, and my sister locking herself in the car.
Skinner: We planned for the wedding cake, we just didn't see the baby thing 
coming.
Chalmers: Well, you should've.
Skinner: How could I? She wasn't even born yet.
Chalmers: People have babies!

Lisa: Actually, I do have a speech prepared.

Wayne: Homer is implanted with several high powerful tracking devices.

Wayne: Your town appears on no maps or charts.
Homer: Yeah, they couldn't find a Google map photo without me naked or 
urinating.
Marge: And when there was a map makers convention here, we all got Lou Gehrig's 
disease.
Homer: Not the one you're thinking of though, there's another one.

Marge: What brought you to Springfield? Was it our Frito Lay distribution 
center?

Moe: Wow, that's the farthest one of my egg ever made it down someone's throat.

Homer: I guess it's not much when you look at real problems in the world like 
Major League umpires not using instant replay.. ok...

Nelson: This place is beautiful as a the side of a Coors Lite bottle. The kind 
my dad used to leave in the bathroom.

Sea Captain: Yar, just plastic. Which is healthier than what you find in the 
ocean.

Ned (to a prostitute who accosts him): Spend less time on your back and more

Homer: Halloween - the one time of the year where the squalor of our home works 
to our advantage.

Homer: I've come around on hipsters. It takes a lot of guts to all wear the 
same hat.

Krusty: Krustyland has a new ride, the Eyeballs of Death. It only passed the 
safety by a 3 to 2 vote. And that third didn't come cheap.

Marge: What if we roll pennies and go to the dollar store?
Homer: That's good, Marge. Get all the terrible ideas out of your system.

star and the referee.

Gordon Ramsay: Stop your bloody winging Marge!
Marge: Aaah! Gordon Ramsay?
Gordon Ramsay: You (bleep) up big blue! Didn't you? Why did you invite Homer? 
He stole your bloody thunder. You're not as (bleep) fun as him and you'll never 
will be. (Marge cries) Darling, darling, crying's not fun. Homer's fun! Now get

Neil Gaiman: I've heisted myself to the bestseller list once again. And the

TweenLit CEO: Is R.L. Stine here? Because you just gave me goosebumps.

Tweenlit CEO: [about the changes made to the group's novel] Don't feel bad. 
Before we got our hands on Twilight, it was about a girl who fell in love with 
a golem, but teens weren't going to spend their allowances to join 'Team 
Shmuel'!

Lisa: Everybody knows you got the idea for the series after an explosion at a 
crumpet factory knocked you off a double-decker bus. How could that be made up?

Bart: The point of the dinosaurs is: no matter what we do, an asteroid is going 
to wipe us out. So we should party hard and wreck the place!
Homer: Yeah, why should the asteroid have all the fun?!

Kids (Johnson, Cindy, Tucker, Turner, and Harper): [Shrieks] A troll!

Homer: Woohoo! No more church!

Robert Marlow: In two weeks, the only tie I'll be wearing will be for auto 
asphyxiation.

Krusty: Why can't I be funny with just my words? Bill Maher doesn't put 
dangerous things near his crotch. Except when he's off work.
%
Krusty: They were kids, and we gave them candy if they laughed! And if they 
didn't, until the 70s, I hit them with a stick! Some jerk tacked down the kids 
and made a documentary. It's called "Circus of Shame" or something.
%
Annie: I was so mad at him, I didn't have sex with a clown for five months!
Homer: What about mimes?

Marge: No more TV! We're going to get some fresh air and visit a museum. Of 
television!

Bart: People also lover a quitter. Sarah Palin. The Beatles.
%
Annie Dubinksy: If you ever hear a star's name and wonder, is he dead? The 
answer is either "I represent him" or "yes."
%
Krusty: And all the movies are over a year old. It's like those parodies were 
written when the movies came out, but it took so long to animate them that we 
look dated and hackey.

Milhouse: I can't believe we put a man on the Sun, but we can't stop my 
sneezing.

material - which meant none of mine.

Milhouse: Why don't you take Zia to your parents for Christmas, while I nurse 
my allergies in one of the non-Christmas celebrating states?

Simpson.
Bart: [scoffs] What did she do?

house, but that is not the point!

Bart: Where's dad?
Lisa: He took the boys out.

Zia: What? Me flashing my boobs on Unripemelons.com?
Lisa: What? No! It doesn't matter what I thought. I'm sorry I spied on you. But 
what I found, is, my daughter looks up to me!
Zia: Well, of course I do! I look up to both my parents!

Milhouse: Could somebody FedEx me a prayer mat? And quick!

Zia: But I especially look up to you.

partying people. Zia slams the door shut and keeps on embracing]

Bart: Boys, I've acted like a ten-year-old for the last 30 years, and I swear 
to you, I will grow up and act like a 20-year-old, the way a divorced 
40-year-old should.
Bart's younger son: You're gonna have to do better than that.
Bart: Boys, I'm a deadbeat dad, I live in a school, it's Christmas. The only 
thing worth anything in my life is you.
Bart's elder son: Oh, Dad.
Bart's younger son: You've taught us the meaning of Christmas. Which schools 
are forbidden to tell us anymore.

Homer: Is it snowing down here?
Wiseguy: No, one of the freezers is busted.

Homer: [touched the boys have forgiven Bart] If those boys can forgive their 
train wreck of a father, maybe I can forgive... [de-freezes grampa]
Grampa: You quit drinking like a coward, the one thing you were good at...
[Homer re-freezes Abe and then de-freezes him]
Grampa: Lawn chair-breaking...
[Homer re-freezes Abe and then de-freezes him]
Grampa: Hair-losing...
[Homer re-freezes Abe and then de-freezes him]
Grampa: Marge-loving...
[Homer re-freezes Abe and then de-freezes him]
Grampa: Barometer dropping
[Homer re-freezes Abe and then de-freezes him]
Grampa: Father freezing.
[Homer re-freezes Abe and then de-freezes him]
Grampa: But you'd always come and get me when I wandered out on the freeway. 
Because deep down you couldn't stand to see me smooshed.

Lenny: When a guy who loves America cries, it makes him super straight.

Apu: The hot dogs spin counter clockwise in fear when you arrive.

Homer: They know I'm doing a character. Like Stephen Colbert or Newt Gingrich.
%
Homer: Do you really need all these Kurt Vonnegut novels?
Lisa: They self-reference each other!
%
Grampa: And I created an alcoholic hippo.
Homer: You never showed it to me!
Grampa: A stupid alcoholic hippo!
Homer: I still want to see it!
Grampa: There is no hippo!
Homer: Then why did you say that?
Grampa: 'Cause you're the hippo!
Homer: Are you just saying that because you don't want me to see the hippo?
Grampa: I don't have a hippo!

Mapple Salesperson: The lightest, most desirable computer in the world, for the 
next three weeks - the Mapple Void.
Homer: I'll take it, provided you charge me for services that Google offers for 
free.
Mapple Salesperson: We already have!
Homer: Sweet.

Lisa: I have a thousand friends! And only eight of them are Milhouse!

Homer: Man, this website makes talking drunk to my wife so much safer.

Lenny: Uh-oh. Doctor Hibbert keeps liking Bumblebee Man's posts. That's how it 
starts.

Bart: From now on, I'll dominate you in ways you don't realize.

Comic Book Guy: Worst climbing Everest!

Bart: I dump on you, and you take it. That's how friendship works.

Homer: Marguerite, I leave to fight in Flanders. Stupid Flanders!

Luigi: Now that's a spicy meet-cube!
%
Homer: We show girls love on Valentine's Day, and they let us blow things up on 
the Fourth of July. I just pray they never fall on the same day.
%
Bart: Luckily, she doesn't know that our viewing platforms are... multi.

Otto: I'll have you know I'm also a hair donor. Salma Hayek wore me to the 
Oscars.

Homer: [on Maggie] Let her slice off the tip of your ear and she'll go right to 
sleep.
Carl: No.
Homer: That's not a choice you get to make.
%
Homer: Ohh, I always thought tarred and feathered was just a figure of speech. 
Good luck patching pot holes and stuffing pillows now!
%
Lisa: I pick up books like you pick up beers!
Homer: Then you have a serious reading problem.
%
Homer: Sorry, Dad. I was afraid of the dragon wouldn't cough the moon back up.
Grampa: You idgit! Dragon always coughs the moon back up.
%
Marge: Don't even bother shooting us. We found a new place we love. It may not 
have indoor plumbing, but it has something else we treasure more.
Homer: Yeah, non jerks!
[The crowd gasps as Quimby and Wiggum realizes they were unfair to the 
Simpsons.]
Marge: In our new community people accept each other for who they are. I 
thought I wanted to come back to my house, but instead I'm going back to my 
Home!
%
Lisa: It's time to start your annual mad dash around town to get her a present 
that's not completely insulting.

Nelson: [holding a ciggarette] You sell ciggaretes to kids.

Milhouse: Every vandalism spree needs an obnoxious laugher.

Apu: For once, the Indian has been outsourced.

Apu: Convenience forever, freshness never!

'Ron English: No refunds [points at no refunds sign]

that's real, is a sign that says "no refunds".

Homer: Attention, lovers of free office supplies - come and steal things you 
can easily afford!

Homer: [on the uralarm] Now that's what I call looking out for a number one.

Homer: Lighten up, Marge. I take you to the Disneyland of me and you just want

Dream Apu: Homer, you do not yet understand the meaning of karma.
Homer: But isn't karma just an expression of the dhrama?
Dream Apu: That is beside the point, okay?
%
Millhouse: My heart makes up for my shortcomings, like Rudy!
Robot: Rudy was only put in at the end of a meaningless game. We will notify 
you if this game comes meaningless.

Homer: What happened to you guys? You used to be cool.
Robot: We are the same temperature we have always been.
%
Homer: I'm all alone, and when there's some problem due to a human error, guess 
who's to blame?
%
Barney: If we've learned anything from The Full Monty, it's that, in a tough 
economy, ugly people strip for money.
%
Jimbo: If I wrote down everything you told me to write down, I'd have no time 
for punching.
Dolph: Whoa, you should write that down, man.

Marge: This is the stupidest fight ever!
Homer: We've had stupider!

Homer: Now I'm going to visit the only court I can never be in contempt to of - 
food court.
%
Homer: Choke on my numb blue hands.
%
Bart: But where does the ship stop again?
Homer: I don't know. A lot of barefoot kids kicking soccer balls, shell 
necklaces, they really hit the poverty nicely.
%
Lisa (as she's being welcomed into the Kid Zone Elite): It's so diverse. I've 
died and gone to a PBS kids' show.
%
Homer (after finding Bart's room empty): Bart's been Raptured and his crap's 
been craptured.
%
Homer: Cleatus the football robot, you're my only hope
%
Homer: And now because it's after noon, I can go to Moe's without having a 
"drinking problem."
Moe: Hey, Homer. I could hear your pathetic rationalizing through the door.
%
Marge: This date night was even worse than the date night we saw Date Night.
%
Marge: Homer, I'm a single mother, trying to raise a family here.
Homer: But you're not-
Marge: Just zip it.
%
Lenny: Trouble in paradise?
Homer: No, my marriage.
%
Homer: Now that's what I call a snappy retort.
Marge: Stop saying what you call things! I'm trying to watch the movie.
%
Ned: Well, sir. Now we'll have an opening marriage.
Edna: Um, you do know what that means?
Ned: No, but I'm sure Newt Gingrich wouldn't steer us wrong.
%
Homer: Mmmm...historically inaccurate.
%
Homer: People here do not respect boundaries.
Ned: Homer, did you just buckle your belt through my loop?
%
Sea Captain: I'm married to the sea, and I'm seeing two of the great lakes on 
the side. I won't say which ones but it's ERIE how SUPERIOR they are.
%
Moe: And that's that. Another story in the classic infallible three-act 
structure. Good enough for Aristotle, good enough for The Simpsons.
Lisa: Mr. Szyslak, I have a feeling there's going to be one more act to this 
story.
Moe: Well I'm not hanging around for that. Pfftt. Four acts.
%
Gaga dancers: [chanting] There is no over the top, there is no over the top.

Gaga: Never forget, you're all my little monsters.
Moe: Actually, I'm half monster, half Armenian. Pick your poison.

Nelson: Lisa, what you did is like my mother sticking ten bucks in her own 
g-string.

Homer: I cheat on my diet, but nobody knows cause the damage is on the inside 
and the first warning sign is sudden death.
%
Bart: Without awards show, how would I know what movie has the best beheading 
or that Glee is a comedy?
%
Wiggum: [on Ralph] Ah, he's a dumb kid, but he's an above average dog. Roll 
over, son!
%
Marge: Just once I'd like your father to be on a Jumbotron for something good.
%
Homer: You've learned a very valuable life lesson, boy. Which is that love 
doesn't exist except briefly between a man and a woman before marriage. After 
that, it's just hanging out with someone who kinda hates you, but you can't get 
it to leave.
%
Bart: Come on, Dad. You love New York, now that your two least favorite 
buildings have been obliterated: Old Penn Station and Shea stadium.
%
Moe: If the late great Nora Ephron taught us anything, it's that - oh, what's 
my other inflatable doll doing here?!?

Bart: Now to get my comic book and explore a world where no one's mad at George 
Lucas.
%
Bart: It's Homer before his boobs came in.
%
Homer: Awww, sweetie, sometimes a mysterious invisible being from hell waits 
for a family to go to sleep then kills them. Now, go to bed.

Homer: A black hole...(whispering) I'm sorry, can we call it that?

Homer: Come on, you can't look at that infinitely dense little guy and not want 
to feed it something.

Frink: Oh my God, Particle!

Moe: Man, soccer's even boring for the ball.

The Rich Texan: Stopping all Americans from voting is for the protection of all 
Americans.

Homer: Marge, I was just being a good husband by pretending to agree with you 
while secretly undermining your agenda.
%
Bart: Oh no, Lisa's face! It's the same.
%
Lisa: I hope you're happy. You all just wasted your time working your way into 
an after school class. Bart, Milhouse, Nelson, and Ralph: Aahhh!
%
Homer: Geez. I mean I'm no Luis GuzmÃ¡n, but I'm alright.
%
Homer: Wait, the frog in the trench coat is Kermit too.
Lenny: All the frogs in that show are Kermit. Keeps all the other frog actors 
out of work.
%
Moe: Hey, don't you badmouth this country. Compared to the rest of the 
third-world, we're doing great.
%
Homer: That's one way to avoid drunk driving.
Marge: Another way is don't drink.
Homer: I'm not Superman.
%
Homer: And I don't think you're boring. It's just that in today's multi-channel 
invironment you have too many choices. Look at Sunday night! There's like eight 
amazing shows, none of them on Fox.

Homer: Happy Anni...birth...tine's...shark week?

Lunchlady Doris: And I promised Paul McCartney I wouldn't sleep with John.

Dan: Fat Tony, a word?
Fat Tony: How about meringue?
Dan: That's a great word.
%
Fat Tony: We are bleeding red ink, which is the only thing we should not be 
bleeding.
%
Dan: How do you keep finding me?
Homer: You really should tweet less.
Dan: But everyone deserves to know what I'm thinking all the time.
%
Homer: A paper-based read-a-ma-jig? What are we, cavemen?
%
Lisa: Willie, I love your chaps.
Willie: Me pants are ripped out!
%
Marge: I don't care for silent auctions. It just encourages hovering.
%
Homer: Free Tibet! You heard me, free him now!
%
Homer: "Hope"? Is this one of those coincidences, like Jesus on a tortilla or 
George Washington on a dollar bill?
%
T-Rex: T.V.? We don't own a T.V.
Lisa: I didn't know that was an option.
%
Homer: No one judges my wife's thunder bags.
%
Homer: Wearing scarves in non-scarf weather is the essence of cool.
%
Marge: The kids are a mess. You brought them home exhausted and pretentious.
%
Marge: You're all bald.
Homer: No, I'm young person cool-bald. Not old person sad-bald.
%
Terrence: You know there are now restaurants there with two locations. Not near 
my kids.
%
Homer: Beat it, ducks! I'm not old enough to have food for you. I'm sexy. Young 
and sexy!
%
Burns: I insist you never wear shoes or a proper necktie again. Just house 
slippers and the most humiliating tie there is - bolo.
%
Herman: God closes a door, he opens a gunshot.
%
Homer: Well, that's just how dogs are. The most disloyal, unfaithful creatures 
god ever made.
%
Grampa: Unfortunately, like all true stories, this one has a crappy ending.
Bart: You have a story with an ending.
%
Bart: He's alive!
Marge: And he didn't pee on the floor.
Grampa: For me, that's a perfect day.
%
Lisa: I love that dog...but that is one long, stupid name.
%
Homer: That's right, your lord sticks his hand in his pants. And yes, it is the 
same hand I tapped you with.
%
Homer: Listen, I gotta know. You're not just being nice to me because, in a 
pinch, you could make candles from my fat.
Lloyd: Well, that is a big part of it.
Homer: It's okay. I know what I am.
%
Homer: Do not question the wisdom of Tom Skerritt.
%
Moe: Well, Homer's gone. Let's all go into our suspended state 'til he gets 
back.
%
Homer: If Jesus had a gun, he'd be alive today.
%
Homer: Marge, this is it. TEOTWAWKI.
Marge: The end of the world as we know it?!?
%
Homer: I guess despite all our so-called civilization, anarchy lurks around 
every corner like a racially diverse street gang on a network cop show.
%
Bart: Dad, what would you do if you got my ear in the mail?
Homer: I don't know; feed it to the dog.
Bart: You'd have to wrap cheese around it.
Homer: Don't you tell me how to feed you to the dog!
%
Fun Center Supervisor (on her cell phone): I hate working here. At least at 
Krusty Burger, you can burn yourself and go home.
%
Bart: Looks like Mr. Vanilla just grew some chocolate chips.
Seymour: Save your analogies for the analogy portion of the exam.
%
Lisa: Well, Bart. I hope you're happy. All my extra credits are like frequent 
flyer miles on a bankrupt airline.
%
Chalmers: I hate waiting. That's why I hate risotto.
Skinner: Even mushroom risotto?
Chalmers: What do you think?!?
%
Mrs. Krabappel-Flanders: We got hired at this school to escape accountability. 
Who's gonna hire a hire a lunchlady who's been accused of murdering her husband?
Lunchlady Doris: Never convicted. They couldn't find the body. Anyone care for 
some chicken Pete pie?
%
Homer: When I found out shrimp cocktails had no alcohol, I really lost interest.
%
Homer: Like all childless couples, they troll the beaches waiting for the 
egg-layers to wander off from their young.
%
Homer: Worry-wart Marge. You don't look a Trojan horse in the mouth.
%
Bart: All you need to know is that I'm a politeness monster who eats "pleases" 
and farts "thank yous", ma'am.
Lisa: I'm exactly the kind of kid he's pretending to be.
%
Marge: I think I hear a slight accent.
Woman: Mid-Atlantic.
Marge: *gasp* That's where they filmed The Wire! Step on it!
%
Homer: What women really want is a guy who's confident enough to go completely 
downhill after marriage and know she'll still love him.
%
Cletus: Anything new that wanders into this house ends up in the stew pot.
%
GPS: Switching to male voice, so you will obey.
Homer: Finally, a supervisor!
%
Mary: [singing] There ain't not never no place none better than home. Count the 
negatives, it all works out.
%
Bart: You got star quality, like the Hulk in movies other than The Hulk.
%
Milhouse: I can't wait to use your moves on Lisa.
Lisa: Eww. On every level, eww.
%
Bart: I'll be more attentive to your needs on the seesaw. I'll stay down there 
as long as you want.
%
Homer: "Spot the hidden objects." Boy, you're pretty pushy for a book I just 
met.
%
(after Marge tells them that she's banning TV from the house)
Homer: Honey, this sounds like a noble experiment, but like Prohibition, it 
will end in a hail of bullets.
%
Bart: That's the way people talk about Ralph. Ralph, who's favorite color is 
peanut butter.
%
(Homer is watching Maggie's Baby Poindexter DVDs)
Bart: Dad, what are you watching?
Homer: I think it's a Terrence Malick movie.
%
Marge: We're taking Maggie to the bookstore, so she can learn the way kids did 
from 1910 to 2002.
%
Marge: (to Homer) Your father wasted his life his whole life being married to 
your mother and having you. We got to find him a boyfriend before it's too late.
Lisa: Why don't you put a personal ad on the Internet? That's how young people 
date these days.
Bart: It's weird that you don't consider yourself a young person.
Lisa: I know. It's weird to me too.
%
Grampa: I don't ride side-saddle. I'm as straight as a submarine.
%
Burns: Hello, Smithers. Fancy seeing you in casual encounter park.
%
Homer: Oh, my gay dad is gay for gays.
%
Homer: Writing is for bathroom walls and acting is for getting out of DUIs.
%
Hibbert: You may never see a film in 3D again. (chuckles)
Homer: But the storytelling is finally catching up to the technology.
%
Lisa: Why does someone become a bully?
Jimbo: Neglect.
Dolph: Abuse.
Kearney: I'm a Cubs fan.
%
Edna: I know you feel guilty about about cold-cocking Homer.
Ned: Please don't use that word in bed.
%
Ned: I want you to punch me in the eye. If you do, then we're even according to 
Exodus, Leviticus, and Matthew.
Homer: You went and hired a law firm, eh. That's pretty aggressive.
%
Ned: Come on, Homer. I'm insisting on a fisting.
Smithers: What's this about a fisting?
%
(Ned comes home and finds his parents and Homer smoking marijuana and watching 
TV)
Ned: Homer, I can't believe you're partaking with my parents.
Homer: Yeah, it's medicinal; we had a pain in our neck!
%
Burns: How much for your entire collection?
Comic Book Guy: Um, the speed of light expressed in dollars.
Burns: [to Smithers] Just give him Faraday's constant.
%
Martin: Who could have shoved eggs up our brass?
%
Cletus: Egg don't belong in a chicken's eye. It belongs in her 
pee-poo-birth-hole.
%
Lisa: Bart must not be judged by these kids. But by a jury...of kids, mostly 
these kids...there's only so many kids.
%
Bart: Pass the gravy, Gloria All-Wrong.
%
Homer: Listen, we swore we'd never go to sleep angry at each other.
Marge: I'm not going to sleep.
Homer: Well, you didn't have two beers with your lunch.
%
Homer: Marge, I thought this was an innocuous lunch, but it's become terribly 
ocuous.
%
Marge: The most romantic part of this was the hold music when I made the 
reservation.
%
Waiter: I hope you are enjoying your sushi.
Marge: It's as yummy as your poorly produced local commercial says.
%
Homer: Well, I'm not one for taking new jobs on a whim. But as we say in the 
snow plow business, I'm your astronaut.
%
Helen: Why won't someone blame the children?
%
Moe: Bring out your beds. Bring out your beds.
%
Homer: Boy, why are your friends so dirty?
Bart: Dunno. Why are your friends such drunks?
Homer: Touche.
%
Homer: Hehehe, the brain is so stupid.
%
Milhouse: Did you ever wonder if hippopotamuses think that rhinos are unicorns?
%
Homer: My head hairs! I'm bald!
%
Moe: There's sexy bald like...uh...Babar, king of the elephants. I read his 
books as a kid. He married his cousin Celeste. That was my takeaway.
%
Martin: Let me go. I have a swim lesson with a gorgeous lifeguard.
Dolph: What gender?
Martin: You're not allowed to ask.
%
Carl: Why don't we talk about it over at Moe's?
Homer: It's not even noon.
Carl: Yeah, I got a watch, egghead.
%
Homer: Sorry, Carl, it's WWII all over again. America kicks Iceland's ass.
%
Homer: And I'm 69 because people always laugh when you say "69." Hehe, no one 
knows why.
%
Moe: Yeah, I always go with three, the number of brothers and sisters I, uh, 
Hunger Gamed in the womb.
%
Patty: So, now you're going to get hit on by ever loser in town.
Selma: And this town has losers like Mexico has headless corpses.
%
Homer: Hey, those Yelp reviews don't write themselves. Did you know a 
well-placed one-star could destroy a "Mom and Pop" hardware in nothing flat?
%
Homer: Just call me Borders Books 'cause I'll always be here.
%
Marge: Accidental motherhood is the best thing that can happen to a woman.
%
Ben: Whoa!, A is for apple, right?
%
Wiggum: When I look at people, I don't see colors; I just see crackpot 
religions.
%
Marge: He's like a husband in a widow's memory, perfect.
%
Lisa: Bart, why is the dad I've always wished for creeping me out?
Bart: I don't know, 'cause you're incapable of experiencing joy?
Lisa: Point taken.
%
Bart: You have some big underpants to fill. I didn't know they made underoos in 
size 52.
Homer: They're called superoos, son, with pictures of the cast of The 
Expendables.
Bart: More like The Expandables.
%
Homer: I'm not sure man who eats right and doesn't drink can be good in bed.
%
Homer: Oh, I've been listening to this son for three days and it's only the end 
of the first verse and was turned vegetarian.
%
Homer: Marge, they knew what they were getting into when their parents sold 
them to the circus.
%
Burns: I don't hand out candy, you son of a Grinch.
%
Homer/The Fat In The Hat: Now hop on my cycle, there's nothing to fear. And we 
shall have candy...and maybe some beer.
%
Homer/The Fat In The Hat (his dying words after Maggie stabs him): I'm 
frightened of nothing/Not even hellfire/Just don't ever let me be played by 
Mike Myers.
%
Reverend Lovejoy: So, is there truly anyone among us without regrets?
Agnes: I have no regrets.
Seymour: Really, Mother?
Agnes: Oh, I didn't see you there.
Mr. Burn: Speaking of return on investments, my Apple stock is up 3,500%.
Homer: Aw, you misheard that on purpose!
%
Milhouse: Why are you doing this, Bart?
Bart: 50% attention-seeking, 50% to drop things on people.
Ralph: He's gonna visit my sky granny.
%
Rafael: (to Homer) That's a ball-proof window, sir. Would you like me to ask 
Siri for a nearby hospital?
Siri: (to Rafael) I'm sorry, I don't see any "hops petals" near you. Deleting 
all contact information.
Rafeal: No, no, I didn't ask you to do that, Siri. I...
Siri: Delete confirmed.
%
Ned Flender: Pray for a miracle, boy. God can hear you better from up there.
Bart: (Pray to God) Dear Lord, please help me land safely. Or transform this 
basket into a flying killer robot that I control with my mind. Amen.
Ned Flender: That's not a prayer.
Bart: My God says it is.
%
Marge: It's all my fault. I should never have listened to those KISS albums 
when I was pregnant.
Chief Wiggum: (to Marge) Marge, with all due respect, that's ridiculous. My 
Sarah listened to Mozart and Churchill speeches when she was pregnant with 
Ralphie, and he can't even open a refrigerator.
%
Eduardo: Did you hair burn off in a fire that trapped you in a candy factory?
Homer: I wish.
%
Marge: I feel kind of melancholy.
Homer: Hmm...melon-collie.
%
Ned: That sounds salty, but you seem sweet. I'm going to call you kettle corn.
%
Willie: You want me to carve it into a thank-o-lantern?
Lisa: No, this is good.
Willie: Well, this knave's got to carve something.
%
Moe: Read 'em and weep. The novels of Charlotte BrontÃ«.
Carl: I thought we were playing cards.
%
Homer: You like lies? Here's a few: College is expensive, but it's worth it.
%
Homer: I'm sorry, Homer, Jr. You'll occupy an idealized place in my heart that 
no one can ever quite fill.
Bart: Therapy, please.
Lisa: Me too.
%
Marge: I'm a Schwarzenegger wife!
Homer: But you're also the housekeeper. So it's all good.
%
Homer: (After imagining telling Marge about Homer Jr.) This simulation has been 
brought to you by your brain, a subsidiary of your penis.
%
Homer: Alright, '80s party! Where's the beef? Tear down that wall because I 
think the beef is behind that wall.
%
Principal Skinner: I must say, Lisa, it was amusing to see you thoroughly 
de-high-horsed.
Lisa: That isn't a word.
Principal Skinner: Oooh, back on the saddle she climbs.
%
Principal Skinner: It's called precipitation because it never fails to 
precipitate bad behavior.
%
Lisa: Excellent! [tents fingers] What am I doing? Untent! Untent!
%
Skinner: You're like egg salad at a picnic, Simpson. Even when you look good, 
we know you're going bad.
%
Lisa: You could do what Everybody Loves Raymond did.
Krusty: Go off the air while I'm still good? That horse has left the stable, 
gone to the glue factory and has been used to make art projects.
%
[after Bart complains to Marge because the family does not believe in him]
Marge: Bart, sweetie. This is an opportunity for you to turn things around... 
yet again. And I believe in you... yet again.
%
[after Homer arrives at the pier]
Bart: [sobs] Skinner didn't let me go. [sobs]
Homer: Really? Oh. I bet that submarine isn't so fun anyway.
Bart: [sniffs] You think so?
%
[in the submarine]
Navy captain: Fire that torpedo, Milhouse!
Milhouse: Aye-aye! [presses a button] Where did it go?
Navy captain: It was just imaginary.
[outside the submarine, the Springfield lighthouse blows up]
%
Marge: Well, there's a rec room off the kitchen. But sometimes it's there and 
sometimes it isn't. Our house is very odd that way.
%
Quimby: Don't you idiots see what this means?
Lenny: Idiots? Why do we re-elect this guy?
Carl: Because his opponent has a long Slavic name.
%
Homer: Global warming. Huh, by pure coincidence every scientist was right.
%
FBI Agent: I'm here to arrest and hopefully stage the prison suicide of the 
mastermind of this operation - Homer Simpson.
%
Lenny: [on piracy] That was so much better than the cinema. It mixes the wonder 
of movie-going with the rush of stealing.
Carl: All we want is brand new, big-budget entertainment in our homes for 
nothing. Why doesn't Hollywood get that?
%
Homer: That was the greatest thing I've seen on a computer that I could talk
