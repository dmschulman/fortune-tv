like that... but in your pants.

Harvey: You stated that you had express knowledge of one of the more familiar 
Superfriend's whereabouts - a Wonder Woman, I believe?
Zan: Um, that's correct. Uh, she was at home.
Harvey: Any idea why she wouldn't have answered the town's distress call?
Zan: Well, she said she really needed some, "me time." So she unplugged her 
communicator and... and took a bath.

Zan: I was... I, I was the bathwater.

Harvey: Oh my God, am I supposed to be prosecuting?
Reducto: Not for the government at least. Look, that man over there.
Harvey: Hm. The jukebox?
Reducto: No! [pulls out a complicated schematic] There is no government, just a 
few multi-national corporations that run everything.

Harvey: One currency? [laughs]
Bartender: Your tab.
Harvey: Right. [counting money] One euro. Two euro.

Harvey: Mr. Boo Boo, would you consider yourself a revolutionary?

Well the Buddha is back, BUT THE BABY GRAND IS STILL MISSING! So, while I 
consider myself to be a benevolent...-ish dictator, I have no choice but to 
introduce a battery of oppressive security measures. Frisking! Cavity searches! 
This easy-to-understand colour-coded crime alert system! And for everyone's 
safety and security, and to preserve our way of life, I'm taking a drastic step

omniscient, unblinking information gathering of everyone's activities.

type without them.

Harvey: Oh, yeah.

Harvey: Our Founding Fathers... guaranteed us certain protections. The freedom 
of speech, freedom of religion, the freedom to own and play stringed 
instruments of all kinds. Those Founding Fathers didn't place restrictions on 
these freedoms. They didn't say, "The right to play guitar shall not be 
violated, except when used to play Green Day's, 'Time of Your Life,' over and 
over again in the common area of your dorm!" *No!* Where will these 
restrictions end? A background check when you want to take up banjo? A five day 
waiting period to buy a Telecaster? An all-out ban on the Flying V or, dare I 
say, whammy bar? Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, it is up to *you* to defend 
our right to keep and bear guitars.
Reducto: Yes, our Founding Fathers were certainly comfortable with the idea of 
the lute or the fiddle, but how could they have foreseen the fretless bass? No! 
There was absolutely no way for them to imagine a time when men would walk the 
streets brandishing Edgar Winter's Special Edition portable keyboards with 
standard MIDI interface.

Elliott: Then, his dating of not just one, but both of the Doublemint Twins.
[The twins get into Harvey's convertible and drive off with him, leaving 
Elliott in the dust]
Elliott: Baffacch! Now his final crime, the crime for which I will exact 
revenge—getting my name wrong. Everyone knows it's Elliott—two l's and two 
t's. I have two of everything, for I am the Deadly Duplicator!
%
Elliott: (thinking) His boss didn't manage to rid the world of the scourge of 
Birdman. I must make more copies of him to shoot, and this time he will 
eliminate the real Birdman.
X: Chose another verb, buddy!
Elliott: (thinking) Oh, ah sorry. He will kill the real Birdman.
X: Better.
%
Harvey Birdmans: I/we know what you've been up to, Elliott, or should I say 
"the Deadly Duplicator". Your reproductive days are over!
Hiram Mightor [quick cutaway] Deedle-deedle-dee.
Elliott: We'll see about that, Birdman, and Birdman, and Birdman, and Birdman, 
and Birdman and Birdman.
%
Phil: I've seen things you people wouldn't believe, and from this side only! 
The flight of a half-man, half-bird. Dinosaurs nuzzling their young in pastures 
where strip-malls should be. Cookies on dowels. All those moments lost in time; 
gone like eggs off a hooker's stomach. Time to die.
%
Mentok: What's the meaning of this? This is my quiet time.
Hiram Mightor: We're going to have to take you into custody.
Mentok: Ha ha. That's outrageous. What am I charged with?
Hiram Mightor: Don't have to tell you anymore. Clearly you haven't been reading 
your Scalia.
%
Harvey: You're a genie?
Mentok: Used to be a genie. I was also a sex worker, a Cossack, and an EST 
instructor for a summer in Marin. My point? I'm in jail, you idiot! Look, 
Shazzan has everyone fooled. He's trying to pin it on me.
Harvey: So, we'll...we'll just go to the judge and tell him your story.
Mentok: I'm a judge! We don't believe anything!
%
Potamus: [to a janitor] Regarding the talc situation—you're out of it!
Avenger: Potamus. Did you flush?
Potamus: Who said that?
Avenger: I did, fatass.
%
Potamus: Oy gault. Please tell me those ain't Heisenberg Brothers Bagels. 
[Tramples to Harvey's desk] What kind should I have?!
Harvey Birdman: I'm uncertain.
Potamus: I haven't had bread for months. I've had a wallear for a Kaiser roll 
or something starchy. Oyster crackers—anything! A sammich without bread isn't 
a sammich—it's meat with mustard on your hands!
%
Phil Ken Sebben: That monster is attacking Judy!
Harvey Birdman: But Phil, he's saving her!
Phil Ken Sebben: My God, you're right! (Presses tank fire button) I can't 
believe it! (Presses tank fire button) I was so wrong about that creature, dead 
wrong. Ha ha! Foreshadowing! About the dead part, not the wrong part. I only 
saw his grotesque visage, not his noble, majestic hearrrrrt.
%
[Phil fumbles a tranquilizer dart, which lands on his crotch]
Phil: Ha, ha, HA! Numby nutkins!
%
Judy: You have to learn to control your anger so the creature doesn't come out. 
First deep breaths. In! (her chest rises) and out! (chest lowers) In! (her 
chest rises) and out! (chest lowers) Feeling calmer?
Potamus: Calmer? No..?!
Judy: Okay let's try POSES! Legs up the wall pose, intense spread leg stretch, 
beaver pose!
Potamus: You won't like me when I'm horny!
%
Potamus: Judy! Sweet tender flexible Judy is trapped by a rack!... (Judy is 
shown trapped in a food rack with bread around her)A rack of carbs!
%
Potamus: I have no idea? I was in a lunchroom trying to open a mustard pak, and 
now my clothes are all ripped up! You gotta help me... WHO AM I! (scene zooms 
out to see Peter with a woman) Hey, Hey! It's starting to come back!
%
[Potamus has taken control of the firm and is sitting in Phil Ken Sebben's 
office]
Judy: Daddy?
Potamus: I love this job.
Judy: Where's daddy?
Potamus: Uh...he went on, uh...a...
[Potamus sees a billboard with 'vacation' partially replaced by 'honeymoon']
Potamus: vaca...neymoon.
Judy: Vacaneymoon? With Aunt Phyllis? He didn't say anything about--
Potamus: They eloped. Silly kids.
Judy: But elopement's for the wedding, not the vacaneymoon.
[Potamus rushes her out of the office]
Potamus: Be happy for them! It's a joyous time!
Judy: Well do you know when he'll be back? I need him to sign this...ugh Sex Ed 
permission slip for my community college.
Potamus: He just said co-co butter...and like that...he was gone.
%
Guy: Hey! You don't have the authority to hire people!
Potamus: Oh yeah? (leans out the window where below, an attractive girl walks 
past) Hey HA HAS! You're hired!
%
Mary: You see, I had to give up my last job so I could take care of my mother. 
And then there's the lunch money that I've been sending to the African 
schoolchildren. So how much is my raise?
Harvey: 20%
Birdgirl: Nothing! In fact, you're fired! Ka-Downsized! You spend five hours a 
day Googling pictures of kittens in rain boots! Get out!
Mary: How could you DO THIS TO ME?!?!?!
Potamus: ...and the school kids.
Harvey: It was Phil!
Mary: HOW DARE YOU BLAME A DEAD MAN, YOU BASTARD!!!

Debbie: Mr.—slight retch—Birdman's office.
X: Hi, Debbie, it's me. Put me through please. [Debbie hangs up] Hello? 
[Redials] It's X. Uh, X the Eliminator? Yeah, I'd like to speak to Harvey if I 
could, please.
Debbie: No, he's booked through December. Try back next year.
X: Look! I need to talk to him, okay? It's regarding tonight's menu!
Debbie: I don't have him down for dinner.
X: I...didn't invite him yet. [Debbie hangs up again] I understand. Short 
notice. [Slams phone down] I hate him!
Zardo: Um, well?
X: He's not coming!

Debbie: Two things: I'm going to lunch, and the office has degraded into 
sectarian violence.

Devlin: Whores are for heroes!

[X dials the number for an Evil Life Coach]
Perfectionist: Hi. I've changed my menu options, so please listen carefully. 
For landscaping, press one. Dog walking, press two. Nude housecleaning, press 
any key any time...
X: [impatiently] Come on, come on, come on...
Perfectionist: If you need an Evil Life Coach, press four.

Voice Mail Prompt: You have... ten... seconds.

PLEASE PLEASE! MAKE ME EVIL!

Harvey: I have to call this number to find out if I have to report for jury 
duty (looks around, sees he is alone) Wait, who am I talking to? (Dials number, 
Mentok answers phone like an automated recording)
Mentok: If your number is greater than 3000...(Harvey looks at his number: 
2147)...you don't have to come in tomorrow.
Harvey: Damn!
Mentok: I'm not finished.
Harvey: Oh.
Mentok: If your number is divisible by 19, you don't have to come in tomorrow
Harvey: Umm...(gets pen and paper)
Mentok: If two trains leave your number at the same time travelling at the same 
speed in different directions, you don't have to come in tomorrow.
Harvey: Hold on...
Mentok: If your number is 2147 or less, you don't have to come in tomorrow.
Harvey: YES!!
Mentok: Unless it IS "2147" WHICH MEANS YOU DO!! WE'LL SEE YOU AT 5:45 AM, 
SUCKERRRR!!!

Harvey: $27.90? But this meal voucher they gave us is only good for three 
dollars.
Elliott the Deadly Duplicator: (behind the counter) Ah-HA-ha-hahaha! Yes! YES! 
The mighty Birdman humbled by a chimichanga! Wait, that thing is $27.90? (clerk 
nods) Are you kidding me?! That's bullshit! He doesn't even get a fountain 
drink! Gimme that! (snatches voucher and duplicates it) There, now you owe him 
$8.10. How's that feel, huh?(Elliot exits cafe, turns left, another Elliot 
comes from right side of the door and jumps on counter) And what the fuck is 
chipotle anyway?!

Harvey: So, your honor, the matter before you is simply—deep breath (deep 
breath), camera starts on Race (Avenger starts camera and focuses on Race 
Bannon and Benton Quest)—should a child's guardian—pan to Apache—who 
suffers injury at the hand of a coffee conglomerate—whip-pan to 
Shaggy/Scooby—be allowed to misconstrue foolish behavior (walks along the 
following clients) as a result of revolutionary political beliefs (Boo Boo 
Bear), all the while flouting copyright protection (Shoyu Weenie), RICO 
statutes (Fred Flintstone) and public indecency laws (Secret Squirrel), 
therefore encouraging discrimination (Inch High, Private Eye) and negligence 
(Ernie Devlin and wife) as well as the great strides we've made vis-à-vis 
automobile safety (Speed Buggy) and drug legislation, Second Amendment (Quick 
Draw McGraw)...
Birdgirl: (dropping off more clients) 26!
Harvey: ...and, er, First Amendment rights (Ding-a-Ling Wolf), working toward a 
positive future (The Jetsons, with Judy in full body cast), or will we devolve 
to a barbaric past (Grape Ape and Beegle Beagle)? Should we duck these 
decisions (Yakky Doodle in Grape Apes teeth) or confront them, removing all 
wrinkles (Droopy Dog with supermodels) and doubts...
Mentok: 16 seconds.
Harvey: Uh...it takes merely the simplest leap (Wally Gator and Ricochet 
Rabbit) to unearth (Morocco Mole) a distinction between savage past (Captain 
Caveman and Cavey Jr.) and barbarism (another caveman)...
Mentok: 4...3...
Birdgirl: (holding Top Cat and vase with Shazzan) 37 and 38! (She runs and 
trips over Inch High, sending them flying into Harvey's arms)
Harvey: ...laws were dictated by roll of the dice. To that I say be careful 
what you wish for, because you just might get it!
Mentok: Don't rub that.
Harvey: I...won't.
Mentok: Are you finished?
Harvey: I think so.
Mentok: See you in a week (disappears into a cloud) BOOOO-WEEEEEOOOOO.
Harvey: Your Honor!
Mentok: What?!
Harvey: Do you have a ruling?
Mentok: Oh, that. All judgments stand as previously ordered.

Harvey: (numbers popping up) Case #398567703296...

Harvey: ...483395639462...
Peanut: ...8.
Birdgirl: Who is it?!
Harvey: Nitron.
Mentok: And he's not alone; I gave him the keys to the Death-Con 12 (12).
Harvey: How could you?!
Mentok: Hey, nobody's perfekt. That's spelled with a K.

Phil: No matter how many times you say that, it still gets me ro- Oh, my God! I 
just did the math! By "Daddy", you don't mean bend me over your knee and call 
the fire department because you have a flamer down there; you mean Daddy! Judy! 
Daughter, is it you?
Everyone in the Background: Yes!
Phil: I can't believe you were trying to get into your own father's pants. Now 
that's just sick. And me helpless, (pointing down) with the one eye.
