Cpl Josh Ray Person: Dear Frederick, thank you for your nice letter, but I am actually a U.S. Marine who was born to kill whereas clearly you have mistaken me for some sort of wine-sipping Communist dick-suck. And although peace probably appeals to tree-loving bisexuals like you and your parents, I happen to be a death-dealing, blood-crazed warrior who wakes up every day just hoping for the chance to dismember my enemies and defile their civilizations. Peace sucks a hairy asshole, Freddy. War is the motherfucking answer.
Sgt Antonio 'Poke' Espera: But thanks for writing, anyway.
Cpl Josh Ray Person: Aww, man, every motherfucker in this camp is just waiting for packages of dip, Ripped Fuel, porn mags, batteries, hash chunks, dirty-ass jerk-off letter from Suzy Rottencrotch, except for Brad Colbert over here, who actually thinks that his mail-order turret is gonna come in before we step off. But no, all we get is this happy-day fucking horseshit from Miss Cunt Lips' fourth grade class. Can you fucking believe this shit?

Cpl Walt Hasser: Stove underneath Rudy's espresso pot went off like a forty mike-mike.
Sgt Antonio "Poke" Espera: Flamed white boy's face like a rotisserie chicken.
Sgt Brad "Iceman" Colbert: Let me understand this. My RTO has just been burned, in his tent, by an exploding portable stove; And without my RTO I will be going to war unable to quickly and effectively establish radio communications within our unit, with other elements of the battalion, and with close air support. Is this what is happening?
Sgt Antonio "Poke" Espera: That and they're probably gonna NJP all our asses for operating a stove in the tent against the regs.
Sgt Brad "Iceman" Colbert: Over an espresso maker. This platoon is going down over an espresso maker.

Sgt Antonio "Poke" Espera: People have been fightin' over this bitch since ancient times, dog. How many graves we standing on? Think about all the wisdom and science and money and civilization it took to build these machines; and the courage of all the men who came here; and the love of their wives and children that was in their hearts. And all that hate, dog. All the hate it took to blow these mother-fuckers away. It's destiny, dog - white man's gotta rule the world.

LCpl Harold James Trombley: No.

SgtMaj John Sixta: I don't care if your Marine has a suckin' chest wound! He will not traipse around on the deck with his shirt tails hangin' out! Might just NJP all your asses!
Sgt Brad "Iceman" Colbert: Yes, Sergeant Major. Corporal Person, be advised; you are expected to conduct all business in this camp in compliance with the grooming standard. By direct order of the battalion commander himself.
[Cpl Person tucks his shirt in, SgtMaj Sixta nods, then stops Sgt Patrick]
SgtMaj John Sixta: Sgt. Patrick. Your mustache hairs is in violations, growing beyond the corner of your mouth. I hear Godfather his self say, you look like a bum. Police that mustache! Y'all startin' to look like Elvises!

Cpl Josh Ray Person: Look at this shit. How come we can't ever invade a cool country, with like chicks in bikinis, you know? How come countries like that don't ever need Marines? I'll tell you why. It's lack of pussy that fucks countries up. Lack of pussy is the root fucking cause of all global instability. If more hajis were getting quality pussy, there'd be no reason for us to come over here and fuck 'em up like this! Cause a nut-bustin' haji is a happy haji.
Evan "Scribe" Wright: [Trying not to laugh] So, this war's not about oil, or WMD's?
Cpl Josh Ray Person: Nope!
Evan "Scribe" Wright: And it's not about Saddam?
Cpl Josh Ray Person: No, Saddam's just part of the problem. If you took the whole gay-ass Republican Guard and comped their asses in Vegas for a weekend- no fuckin' war! Look, if Saddam invested more in the pussy infrastructure of Iraq than he did on his fuckin' gay-ass army, then this country would be no more fucked up than, say, Mexico.

Cpl Josh Ray Person: See, Trombley asked about shooting people. I asked about pussy. The guy told me I'd get to go to Thailand, get all kinds of strange. What'd you ask about, Brad? Brad probably saw that T.V. commercial, the one with the knight that fucks up the dragon then turns into the Marine.
Cpl Walt Hasser: Woo woo! Dress blues with a sword!
Cpl Josh Ray Person: Fucking dress blues commercial man. That got so many fucking guys. Now look at us: Trombley hasn't killed anybody, I'm half a world away from good Thai pussy, and Colbert is out here rolling around fuckbutt Iraq, hunting for dragons in a MOPP suit that smells like four days of piss and ball sweat.

Sgt. Antonio "Poke" Espera: Dog. We was like 13 or 14, hanging around in this neighborhood I grew up in, just east of L.A. We saw some cholos from another hood. And we thought we was all hard, gang-banger wanna be’s, so we started saying “Fuck off, yo. Fuck off” Throwin’ and flashing signs to ‘em and stuff. So they started throwing down on us “Wha, wha, wha, wha”, kicking our little asses. And some of the older dogs from our hood came out, grabbed those fools. Took one behind Tasty Freeze, they stabbed him up, with a screwdriver. Killed that cholo. See, generally, white people; they don’t drag a dude behind a Tasty Freeze and stab him to death with a screwdriver. So, after that day, I decided, I’m gonna hang with white people.

Cpl. Nathan Christopher: Well, what does that mean, sir?
Lt. Nathaniel “Nate” Fick: It means we’re on one meal a day.

Cpl. Josh Ray Person: I’m betting that they were thinking that they could just, you know, leave a fully loaded supply truck laying around, just like you could anywhere in America, you know. I mean, you park your unlocked car in Detroit or Baltimore, I mean, your shit’s going to be there, guaranteed, when you get back from the day spa with your skin all exfoliated and shit, right. I mean, seriously homes, why would our Iraqi brethren want four hundred pounds of C4, claymores and crates of M-16’s? I mean, it just doesn’t make any sense. Oh wait, you know they could be using all that C4 for like a giant ! [Looks up at Colbert, who is sitting on the Humvee nearby] What do you think, Brad?

We're out here, 40 klicks in enemy lines, and this man of God here, he's a fuckin' . In fact, he's an officer POG. That's one more layer of bureaucracy and unnecessary logistics, one more asshole we need to supply MREs and baby wipes for. And worst of all, worst of all, the motherfucker doesn't even carry a weapon. When push comes to shove even Rolling Stone picks up a gun but this fuckin' shill of God, he can't cover a sector, he'll never hump ammo or Claymores. This is a fuckin' war and we're here as warriors, so on top of everything else that's expected of us do we really need to drag him along and indulge in this make-believe bullshit?

Sgt. Antonio "Poke" Espera: Na, na, na, na, Brad. You cannot say that you like Pocahontas. The genocide of my peoples turned into a cartoon musical with a singing raccoon.

I was one of those unfortunates adopted by upper middle-class professionals and nurtured in an environment of learning, art and a socio-religious culture steeped in more than 2000 years of Talmudic tradition.

Cpl. Josh Ray Person: This is really interesting, Brad. You know, Iraqis don't really seem good at fighting, but then they never really completely surrender either.
Sgt. Brad 'Iceman' Colbert: Put down that fucking milkshake and dig a fucking hole.
Cpl. Josh Ray Person: Why, so I can be more like the teacher's pet?
Sgt. Brad 'Iceman' Colbert: Yeah, that's exactly it. You should be more like Trombley.
Cpl. Josh Ray Person: More like Trombley? [shouts] MORE LIKE TROMBLEY?!

Sgt. Brad 'Iceman' Colbert: I want you to know you done good, Tony. You earned a lot of reputation in the recon community as my ATL. You always had my six and... I just want you to know that I really appreciate that. And it's been, uh--
Sgt. Antonio 'Poke' Espera: You realize the shit that we've done here? The people we've killed? Back in the civilian world, dog, if we did this... we would go to prison.
Sgt. Brad 'Iceman' Colbert: Poke, you're thinking like a Mexican again. Think like a white man. Over there they'll be laying on medals for what we did.

Cpl. Anthony 'Manimal' Jacks : I'm gonna hit that shit!
Cpl. Evan 'Q-Tip' Stafford : You must be wearing your desert goggles, that ain't nothing but a piece of nappy-haired Whiskey Tango.
Cpl. James Chaffin: He's right, man, you ain't hittin' shit. W.M. like that, nah, she be wearing kevlar panties nailed on top of a concertina wire bush.
Cpl. Anthony 'Manimal' Jacks : Yeah, well, I'm gonna do a recon poo. I'm gonna make a path for all you motherfuckers.
Cpl. James Chaffin: Shit, man, can you imagine the stank on that cunt?
Cpl. Anthony 'Manimal' Jacks : That is exactly where I am going. Yes sir, I'm going to go down on her like she got all of Saddam's WMDs just buried right between her legs [pulls out his gas mask and starts "eating it out] Brrr!
Cpl. James Chaffin: You better dig deep! Oh yeah, baby. Get in there, Jacks. Give it a little tap! Pat it, pat it!
Sgt. Antonio 'Poke' Espera: It's not that bad over here. Don't kill yourself like that.
[Manimal puts on the gas mask]
Cpl. James Chaffin: Shit, go get it baby. Get some for old J.C. Get Some!
[Manimal starts walking over to the female ]
Cpl. James Chaffin: Oh, shit. Smash!

Cpl. Josh Ray Person: What the fuck did you do to him?
Evan 'Scribe' Wright: Just asked him what he would be if he wasn't a Marine.

Sgt. Brad 'Iceman' Colbert: There's something I've been keeping from you. I wasn't sure we were gonna live to share this moment.
Cpl. Josh Ray Person: ! The master!
Sgt. Brad 'Iceman' Colbert: Celebrate. Trombley, get a fire going. Walt, here.
Cpl. Josh Ray Person: You deceiving, conniving, Hebrew motherfucker. How were you gonna to keep this from your dearest pal Ray-Ray?
Sgt. Brad 'Iceman' Colbert: I got one more secret to share.
Cpl. Josh Ray Person: !
Sgt. Brad 'Iceman' Colbert: No no no no no wait wait wait, not yet! I need some time with this alone!
Cpl. Josh Ray Person: Come on, just give me one --
Sgt. Brad 'Iceman' Colbert: Just calm down! You'll get your sloppy seconds with Jasmine. Ray, you gotta share with Trombley.
Cpl. Josh Ray Person: What?! He'll kill her!
Lance Cpl. Harold James Trombley: Eat, fuck, kill -- all the same, right?
Cpl. Josh Ray Person: Yeah, all the same if you're a fucking psycho! Brad, I'm telling you, I fear for Jasmine.
Evan 'Scribe' Wright: Speaking of which -- one of you guys still has my girlfriend's picture.
Cpl. Josh Ray Person: Dude, I hate to tell you this, but your girlfriend's kind of a whore.
Evan 'Scribe' Wright: What?
Cpl. Josh Ray Person: Yeah. Last time I saw her, she was doing all of H & S Company.

[A group of the Marines are opening letters from the U.S.; "Manimal" is saddened and infuriated that his wife is divorcing him.]
Cpl. Anthony "Manimal" Jacks: Shit, I'd like to call in some danger close on my wife. That's for fuckin' sure. [Kicks a stack of gear furiously] Maybe fly some Cobras up her fuckin' lawyer's ass, too!
[Gunnery Sergeant Wynn and Sergeant Major Sixta are watching, standing in the background.]
GSgt. Mike Wynn: It ain't all joy and laughter, is it? Mail call kinda brings it all home.
SgtMaj. John Sixta: If morale gets really bad, Mike, let me know. I'll stir 'em up good with the grooming standard. [Winks]

Evan "Scribe" Wright: Colonel.
LTC Stephen "Godfather" Ferrando: So what'd you see, reporter? [Wright pauses, unsure where to start] No other military in the world can do what we do. The Marines are America's shock troops. There anything you wanna ask me before you unhitch your wagon?
Evan "Scribe" Wright: Captain Americ- [Ferrando looks at him strangely] Captain McGraw, sir.
LTC Stephen "Godfather" Ferrando: All right, now- he walked a fine line. Okay? But in the end, he was within the box of acceptable behavior. But in my mind, when you allow that type of behavior to progress, you end up with a My Lai. [Glances at Wright] You think I should've taken a harsher action.
Evan "Scribe" Wright: Two attempted bayonetings.
LTC Stephen "Godfather" Ferrando: But no prisoners actually wounded. All right; now, I wasn't there to see what happened, and I have conflicting reports from those who were. But we're in a war zone, reporter. And if I expect my subordinates to remain effective in combat, then I have to show them trust. Until it's proven to me- beyond any doubt- that they are undeserving of that trust. Now, the same support I extend to Captain McGraw, is extended to all my officers. Lieutenant Fick, for example. I'm sure you're aware that there's some in this battalion who feel that Lieutenant Fick is unfit for command.
Evan "Scribe" Wright: [Laughs] You should consider your sources, sir.
[Ferrando leans back, waving this aside.]
LTC Stephen "Godfather" Ferrando: So what happens to my command if I respond to every complaint made against one of my men? [He pauses] It's a terrible feeling, to be the man sending other people into combat. Terrible feeling. But something else I'm struggling with... is the excitement I felt. Getting shot at. That's something I just didn't anticipate about war.

Sgt. Brad "Iceman" Colbert: [Catching up with Ray] You all right?

Sergeant Antonio 'Poke' Espera: The priest told me it's not a sin to kill if you don't enjoy killing. My question is whether indifference is the same as enjoyment.
Sgt. Brad 'Iceman' Colbert: All religious stuff aside, the fact is, people who can't kill will always be subject to those who can.
