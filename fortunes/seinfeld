Jerry: Men are not subtle — men are obvious. Women know what men want. Men 
know what men want. What do we want? We want women! It's the only thing we know 
for sure: we want women! How do we get women? Oh, we don't know that. The next 
step after that we have no idea. This is why you see men honking car-horns, 
yelling from construction sites. These are the best ideas we've had so far. The 
car-horn honk, is that a beauty? Have you seen men doing this? What is this? 
The man is in the car, the woman walks by the front of the car, he honks. 
E-eeehh, eehhh, eehhh! This man is out of ideas. How does it…? 
E-e-e-eeeehhhh! "I don't think she likes me." The amazing thing is, that we 
still get women, don't we? Men, I mean, men are with women. You see men with 
women. How are men getting women, many people wonder. Let me tell you a little 
bit about our organization. Wherever women are, we have a man working on the 
situation right now. Now, he may not be our best man, okay, we have a lot of 
areas to cover, but someone from our staff is on the scene. That's why, I 
think, men get frustrated, when we see women reading articles, like "Where to 
meet men?" We're here, we are everywhere. We're honking our horns to serve you 
better.

George: All right, if she puts the bags down before she greets you, that's a 
good sign.
Jerry: Right.
George: You know, anything in the, in the lip area is good.
Jerry: Lip area.
George: You know, a hug: definitely good.
Jerry: Hug is definitely good.
George: Sure.
Jerry: Although what if it's one of those hugs where the shoulders are 
touching, the hips are eight feet apart?
George: That's so brutal, I hate that.
Jerry: You know how they do that?
George: That's why, you know, a shake is bad.
Jerry: Shake is bad, but what if it's the two-hander? The hand on the bottom, 
the hand on the top, the warm look in the eyes?
George: Hand sandwich.
Jerry: Right.
George: I see, well, that's open to interpretation. Because so much depends on 
the layering and the quality of the wetness in the eyes.
%
Jerry: There's something about a check that, to a man, is not masculine. I 
don't know exactly what it is... I think to a man, a check is like a note from 
your mother that says "I don't have any money, but if you'll contact these 
people, I'm sure they'll stick up for me... If you just trust me this one time 
I don't have any money but I have these... I wrote on these; is this of any 
value at all?"

Jerry: [while playing Scrabble] "Quone"?
Helen: ...30...31...
Jerry: "Quone"? No, I'm afraid that I'm going to have to challenge that.
[Jerry picks up the dictionary]
Helen: ...32...
Kramer: No, you don't have to challenge that. That's a word. That's a definite 
word.
Jerry: I am challenging.
Kramer: Quone. To quone something.
Jerry: Uh-huh.
[Jerry looks up the word]
Helen: I'm not playing with you anymore.
Morty: Quone's not a word.
Jerry: [showing the dictionary] No good. Sorry. There it is. Get it off.
Helen: [to Kramer] Why did you make me put that down?
Kramer: Nah, we need a medical dictionary! If a patient gets difficult, you 
quone him.
%
Kramer: [Realizing that the robbery was his fault] Look, Jerry, I'm sorry, I'm 
uh, you have insurance, right buddy?
Jerry: No.
Kramer: How can you not have insurance?
Jerry: Because...I spent my money on the Clapgo D. 29, it's the most 
impenetrable lock on the market today...it has only one design flaw:the door... 
[closing door] must be closed!
Kramer: Jerry! I'm gonna find your stuff. I'm gonna solve it, I'm on the case, 
buddy, I'm on the case!
Jerry: Yeah, don't investigate, don't pay me back, it was an accident.
Kramer: I made a mistake.
Elaine: These things happen.
Kramer: I'm human
Jerry: In your way.
%
Jerry: I got ripped off for about the...18th time? And now, the first couple a 
times you go through it, it's very upsetting and your first reaction or one of 
your friends will say: "Call the police. You really should call the police." So 
you think to yourself, ya know, you watch TV, you think: "Yeah, I'm calling the 
police. Stakeouts, manhunts...I'm gonna see some real action." Right, you think 
that. So, the police come over to your house...they fill out: the report...they 
give you: your copy. Now...unless they give the crook his copy, I don't really 
think we're gonna crack this case, do you?...It's not like Batman, where 
there's three crooks in the city and everybody pretty much knows, who they are. 
Very few crooks even go to the trouble to come up with a theme for their 
careers anymore. It makes them a lot tougher to spot. "Did you lose a Sony? It 
could be the Penguin...I think we can round him up, he's dressed like a 
PENGUIN! We can find him, he's a PENGUIN!

George: She calls me up at my office. She says, "We have to talk."
Jerry: Ugh. The four worst words in the English language.
George: That or "Whose bra is this?"
Jerry: That's worse.

Elaine: Come on. Let's go do something. I don't want to just sit around here. 
Wanna get something to eat?
Jerry: Where?
Elaine: I don't care. I'm not hungry.
Jerry: We could go to one of those cappuccino places. They let you just sit 
there.
Elaine: What are we gonna do there, talk?
Jerry: We can talk.
Elaine: I'll go if I don't have to talk.
Jerry: Then we'll just sit there.

Jerry: I think Superman probably has a very good sense of humor.
George: I never heard him say anything really funny.
Jerry: But it's common sense. He's got super strength, super speed.. I'm sure 
he's got super humor.
George: You would think that, but either you're born with a sense of humor, or 
you're not. It's not going to change even if you go from the red sun of Krypton 
all the way to the yellow sun of the Earth.
Jerry: Why? Why would that one area of his mind not be affected by the yellow 
sun of Earth?
George: I don't know but he ain't funny.
%
Elaine: What evidence is there that cats are so smart, anyway? Huh? What do 
they do? Because they're clean? I am sorry. My Uncle Pete showers four times a 
day and he can't count to ten. So don't give me hygiene.
Jerry: So what are you gonna do?
Elaine: I don't know. I can't think of any solution, unless of course they 
should meet with some unfortunate accident. What do you think a hit man would 
charge to rub out a couple of cats?
Jerry: Well, it couldn't be too expensive. Thirteen, fourteen bucks a cat?
Elaine: What do you think, Jerry? You wanna make twenty-eight bucks?
Jerry: I'm no cat killer.

Kramer: [about his cantaloupe] Forty-nine cents a pound. That's practically 
half than what you're paying at the supermarket. I don't know why you don't go 
to Joe's.
Jerry: It's too far.
Kramer: It's three blocks further. You can use my shopping cart.
Jerry: I'm not pulling a shopping cart. What am I suppose to wear? A kerchief? 
Put stockings on and roll 'em down below my knee?
Kramer: See, the other thing is, if you don't like anything, he takes it right 
back.
Jerry: I don't return fruit. Fruit is a gamble. I know that going in.
%
Jerry: The waiting room. I hate when they make you wait in the room. 'Cause it 
says "Waiting Room." There's no chance of not waiting. 'Cause they call it the 
waiting room, they're gonna use it. They've got it. It's all set up for you to 
wait. And you sit there, you know, and you've got your little magazine. You 
pretend you're reading it, but you're really looking at the other people. You 
know, you're thinking about them. Things like, "I wonder what he's got. As soon 
as she goes, I'm getting her magazine." And then, they finally call you and 
it's a very exciting moment. They finally call you, and you stand up and you 
kinda look around at the other people in the room. "Well, I guess I've been 
chosen. I'll see you all later." You know, so you think you're going to see the 
doctor, but you're not, are you? No. You're going into the next waiting room 
– the littler waiting room. But if they are, you know, doing some sort of 
medical thing to you, you want to be in the smallest room that they have, I 
think. You don't want to be in the largest room that they have. You know what I 
mean? You ever see these operating theatres that they have, with like, stadium 
seating? You don't want them doing anything to you that makes other doctors go, 
"I have to see this! Are you kidding? Are they really gonna do that to him? Are 
there seats? Can we get in?" Do they scalp tickets to these things? "I got two 
for the Winslow tumor, I got two…"

George: You know, I've been thinking. I cannot envision any circumstance in 
which I'll ever have the opportunity to have sex again. How's it gonna happen? 
I just don't see how it could occur.
%
Jerry: I didn't know she had a pony. How was I to know she had a pony? Who 
figures an immigrant's going to have a pony? Do you know what the odds are on 
that? I mean, in all the pictures I saw of immigrants on boats coming into New 
York harbor, I never saw one of them sitting on a pony. Why would anybody come 
here if they had a pony? Who leaves a country packed with ponies to come to a 
non-pony country? It doesn't make sense...am I wrong?
%
Jerry: This jacket has completely changed my life. When I leave the house in 
this, it's with a whole different confidence. Like tonight, I might've been a 
little nervous. But, inside this jacket, I am composed, grounded, secure that I 
can meet any social challenge.
George: Can I say one thing to you? And I say this with an unblemished record 
of staunch heterosexuality.
Jerry: Absolutely.
George: It's fabulous.
%
Jerry: I had a leather jacket that got ruined. Now, why does moisture ruin 
leather? I don't get this. Aren't cows outside most of the time? I don't 
understand it. When it's raining do cows go up to the farmhouse, "Let us in, 
we're all wearing leather. Open the door! We're gonna ruin the whole outfit 
here!" "Is it suede?" "I am suede, the whole thing is suede, I can't have this 
cleaned. It's all I got!"
%
Jerry: The bad thing about television is that everybody you see on television 
is doing something better than what you're doing. Did you ever see anybody on 
TV like just sliding off the front of the sofa with potato chip crumbs on their 
face? Some people have a little too much fun on television: the soda commercial 
people - where do they summon this enthusiasm? Have you seen them? "We have 
soda, we have soda, we have soda", jumping, laughing, flying through the air - 
it's a can of soda. Have you ever been standing there and you're watching TV 
and you're drinking the exact same product that they're advertising right there 
on TV, and it's like, you know, they're spiking volleyballs, jetskiing, girls 
in bikinis and I'm standing there - "Maybe I'm putting too much ice in mine."
%
Jerry: I love my phone machine. I wish I was a phone machine. I wish if I saw 
somebody on the street I didn't want to talk to I could go "Excuse me, I'm not 
in right now. If you could just leave a message, I could walk away." I also 
have a cordless phone, but I don't like that as much, because you can't slam 
down a cordless phone. You get mad at somebody on a real phone - "You can't 
talk to me like that!" Bang! You know. You get mad at somebody on a cordless 
phone - "You can't talk to me like that!" [Mimes fiddly button-pressing] "I 
told him!"

George: [about Elaine taking the apartment above Jerry] How could you do that?
Jerry: 'Cause I'm an idiot! You may think you're an idiot, but with all due 
respect - I'm a much bigger idiot than you are.
George: Don't insult me, my friend. Remember who you're talking to. No one's a 
bigger idiot than me.
Jerry: Did you ever ask an ex-girlfriend to move into your building?
George: Did you ever go to a singles weekend in the Poconos?
Jerry: She's right in my building! Right above me! Every time I come in the 
building, I'm gonna have to sneak around like a cat burglar.
George: You're doomed. You're gonna have to have all your sex at women's 
apartments. It'll be like a permanent road trip. Forget about the home bed 
advantage.
Jerry: But I need the home bed advantage!
George: Of course, we all do.
%
Jerry: You have no idea what an idiot is. Elaine just gave me a chance to get 
out and I didn't take it. This (pointing to himself) is an idiot.
George: Is that right? I just threw away a lifetime of guilt-free sex, and 
floor seats for every sporting event in Madison Square Garden. So please, a 
little respect, for I am Costanza, Lord of the Idiots.
Roxanne: [yelling out the window to the marathon runners] You're all winners!

George: When I was ten years old, my parents had this very same statue on the 
mantle of our apartment. Exactly, and, one day, I grabbed it, and I was using 
it as a microphone. I was singing, "MacArthur Park", and I got to the part 
about, "I'll never have that recipe again," and it slipped out of my hand and 
it broke. My parents looked at me like I smashed the Ten Commandments. To this 
day, they bring it up. It was the single most damaging experience in my life, 
aside from seeing my father naked.

Kramer: Police! Open up!
Ray: Police? [Opens the door a crack - Kramer barges in like a cop. He forces 
Ray against the wall]
Kramer: Freeze, mother!
Ray: Hey..
[Kramer shoves him roughly against the wall]
Kramer: Shut up. Spread 'em. I said spread 'em! [Looks around] You're in big 
trouble son. Burglary, grand larceny, possession of stolen goods.. and uh, uh.. 
murder.
Ray: Murder?!
[Kramer shoves him against the wall]
Kramer: Shut up! Keep 'em spread! Just make love to that wall, pervert!
Ray: I think you have me confused with somebody else.
Kramer: Is your name Ray?
Ray: Yeah.
Kramer: Yeah, you're the punk I'm looking for. [Grabs the statue from the 
mantle, and puts it in his bag]
Ray: Hey, hey, are you a cop?
Kramer: Yeah, I'm a cop. I'm a good cop. I'm a damn good cop! Today's your 
lucky day, junior, 'cause I'm gonna let you off with a warning. Any more of 
this criminal activity, and you'll be sorry. You got me?
Ray: Got you? I don't even know what the hell you're talking about.
Kramer: Good. Good. Let's keep it that way.

George: Maybe I could be like, an announcer. Like a color man. You know how I 
always make those interesting comments during the game.
Jerry: Yeah. Yeah. You make good comments.

are, you know, in broadcasting.
George: Well, that's really not fair.

Elaine: So I'm going to a nudist colony next week.
Rick: Nudist colony?
Elaine: Oh yeah, yeah I love nudist colonies. They help me unwind.
Rick: I've never been to one.
Elaine: Oh really? You should go; they're great! Except when they're over it's 
hard to get used to clothes, so sometimes when I'm in my office I just sit 
there naked.
Rick: Really?
Elaine: Oh yeah, I usually sit around naked a couple hours a day. I cook naked, 
I clean naked, I drive naked, naked, naked, naked!
Rick: Who are you!?
Elaine: Trust me mister, you don't wanna know.

Jerry: [after the doctor tells him George did not have a heart attack] Oh, 
and.. do you think it would be alright if I called Susan Davis?
George: Susan Davis? Hey, wait a second..
Jerry: Well, it's not like we'd be bumping into you.
George: I don't know.. you and Susan Davis?
Jerry: You know, if your future was a little more certain..
George: Okay, go ahead. Call her, get married, have babies, have a great life.. 
What do I care? I'm finished. It's all over for me. In fact, let's end it right 
now. Jerry, kill me, kill me now. I'm begging you. Let's just get it over with. 
Be a pal.. Just take the pillow and put it over my face.
Jerry: Well, ah.. [Takes his pillow] What? Kind of like this? [Violently 
smothers George with the pillow. George freaks out.]
George: What are ya doing?! Whadya, crazy?!
[Elaine enters and sees Jerry's jokingly trying to kill George]
Elaine: Jerry!
Jerry: [pretending to panicked] Elaine, what are you doing here?
%
Tor: No. You know, I am not a businessman. I'm a holistic healer. It's a 
calling, it's a gift. You see, it's in the best interest of the medical 
profession that you remain sick. You see, that insures good business. You're 
not a patient. You're a customer.
Jerry: And you're not a doctor, but you play one in real life.
%
Jerry: Why shouldn't we be able to do that once in a while if we want to?
Elaine: I know.
Jerry: I mean, really, what is the big deal? We go in there. [Points to the 
bedroom] We're in there for a while. We come right back out here. It's not 
complicated.
Elaine: It's almost stupid if we didn't.
Jerry: It's moronic.
Elaine: Absurd!
Jerry: Of course, I guess, maybe, some little problems could arise.
Elaine: Well, there are always a few.
Jerry: I mean, if anything happened, and we couldn't be friends the way we are 
now, that would be really bad.
Elaine: Devastating.
Jerry: Because this is very good. [Points back and forth between them to 
indicate friendship]
Elaine: And that would be good. [Points to bedroom]
Jerry: That would be good too. The idea is combine the this and the that. But 
this cannot be disturbed.
Elaine: Yeah, we just wanna take this and add that.
Jerry: But of course, we'd have to figure out a way to avoid the things that 
cause the little problems. Maybe some rules or something.
Elaine: Huh.
Jerry: For example, now, I call you whenever I'm inclined and vice versa.
Elaine: Right.
Jerry: But if we did that, we might feel a certain obligation to call.
Elaine: Well why should that be? Oh, I have an idea. I have an idea. No call 
the day after that.
Jerry: Beautiful. Let's make it a rule.
Elaine: All right, sir.
Jerry: Now here's another little rule. When we see each other now, we retire to 
our separate quarters. But sometimes, when people get involved with that, they 
feel pressure to sleep over. When that is not really sleep. Sleep is separate 
from that. And I don't see why sleep got all tied up and connected with that.
Elaine: Okay, okay. Spending the night is optional!
Jerry: Well now we're gettin' somewhere.
%
Jerry: So how's the job situation goin'?
George: Still lookin'. It's pretty bad out there. What about you?
Jerry: Nothin' much. I slept with Elaine last night.
George: [stunned] Oxygen! I need some oxygen! This is major!
Jerry: I thought you'd like that.
George: Oh, this is huge!
Jerry: I know.
George: All right, okay. Let's go, details.
Jerry: No, I can't do details.
George: You what?
Jerry: I can't give details.
George: No details?
Jerry: I'm not in the mood.
George: You ask me to have lunch, tell me you slept with Elaine, and then say 
you're not in the mood for details. Now you listen to me. I want details and I 
want them right now. I don't have a job, I have no place to go. You're not in 
the mood? Well you get in the mood!

George: Every woman on the face of the Earth has complete control of my life 
and yet, I want them all. Is that irony?
%
Elaine: Ya know, its not fair people are seated First Come First Served, It 
should be based on who's hungriest. I feel like just going over there and 
taking some food off somebody's plate.
Jerry: I'll tell you what, there's 50 bucks in it for you if you do it.
Elaine: What do you mean?
Jerry: You walk over that table, you pick up an eggroll, you don't say 
anything, you eat it, say 'thank you very much', wipe your mouth, walk away- I 
give you 50 bucks.
George: What are they gonna do?
Jerry: They won't do anything; in fact, you'll be giving them a story to tell 
for the rest of their lives.
Elaine: 50 bucks, you'll give me 50 bucks?
Jerry: 50 bucks. That table over there, the three couples.
Elaine: OK, I don't wanna go over there and do it, and then come back here and 
find out there was some little loophole, like I didn't put mustard on it or 
something...
Jerry: No, no tricks.
Elaine: Should I do it, George?
George: For 50 bucks? I'd put my face in the soup and blow.
%
Jerry: So what happened with Tatiana?
George: I shouldn't even tell you this.
Jerry: Come on...
George: Well, after dinner last week, she invites me back to her apartment.
Jerry: I'm with you.
George: Well, it's this little place with this little bathroom. It's like right 
there, you know, it's not even down a little hall or off in an alcove. You 
understand? There's no... buffer zone. So, we start to fool around, and it's 
the first time, and it's early in the going. And I begin to perceive this 
impending...intestinal requirement, whose needs are going to surpass by great 
lengths anything in the sexual realm. So I know I'm gonna have to stop. And as 
this is happening I'm thinking, even if I can somehow manage to 
momentarily...extricate myself from the proceedings and relieve this 
unstoppable force, I know that that bathroom is not gonna provide me with the 
privacy that I know I'm going to need.
Jerry: This could only happen to you.
George: So I finally stop and say, "Tatiana, I hope you don't take this the 
wrong way, but I think it would be best if I left".
Jerry: You said this to her after.
George: No. During.
Jerry: Oh, boy.
George: Yeah.
Jerry: Wow! So...?
George: So I'm dressing and she's staring up at me, struggling to compute this 
unprecedented turn of events. I don't know what to say to reassure this woman, 
and worst of all, I don't have the time to say it. The only excuse she might 
possibly have accepted is if I told her I am in reality Batman, and I'm very 
sorry, I just saw the Bat-Signal.
%
Jerry: I think the busboy's in trouble.
George: Did I get him in trouble? Because of what I said? I just told him what 
happened. He didn't do it on purpose! [The manager and the busboy are arguing, 
The busboy points in the direction of George.] He pointed at me. Why did he 
point at me?
Elaine: I said I would never eat here again. But, I, I.. he had to know I was 
kidding.
Jerry: [casually] I didn't say anything.
%
Elaine: I never knew I could drive like that. I was going faster than I've ever 
gone before, and yet, it all seemed to be happening in slow motion. I was 
seeing three and four moves ahead, weaving in and out of lanes like an Olympic 
skier on a gold metal run. I knew I was challenging the very laws of physics. 
At Queens Boulevard, I took the shoulder. At Jewel Avenue, I used the median. I 
had it. I was there.. and then.. I hit the Van Wyck. They say no one's ever 
beaten the Van Wyck, but gentlemen, I tell you this - I came as close as anyone 
ever has. And if it hadn't been for that five-car-pile-up on Rockaway 
Boulevard, that numbskull would be on a plane for Seattle right now instead of 
looking for a parking space downstairs.

George: A man gave me...
Jerry: Yes, a man gave you...?
George: A man gave me... a massage.
Jerry: So?
George: So he... had his hands and, uh, he was...
Jerry: He was what?!
George: He was... touching and rubbing.
Jerry: That's a massage.
George: And then I took my pants off.
Jerry: You took your pants off?
George: For my hamstring.
Jerry: Oh.
George: He got about two inches from... there.
Jerry: Really?
George: I think it moved.
Jerry: Moved?
George: It may have moved, I don't know.
Jerry: I'm sure it didn't move.
George: It moved! It was imperceptible but I felt it.
Jerry: Maybe it just wanted to change positions? You know, shift to the other 
side.
George: No, no. It wasn't a shift, I've shifted, this was a move.
Jerry: Okay, so what if it moved?
George: That's the sign! The test; if a man makes it move.
Jerry: That's not the test. Contact is the test, if it moves as a result of 
contact.
George: You think it's contact? It has to be touched?
Jerry: That's what a gym teacher once told me.

[George enters, his pants are ripped at the knee]
Jerry: What happened to you?
George: One of those kids called me a Mary.
Elaine: A what?
George: I was jumping over a puddle and for some reason I went like this. 
[George stretches out his arms in a ballet motion] They called me a Mary. So I 
chased them, and I tripped and I fell.
Kramer: Yeah, you know kids, they can be very perceptive.

Elaine: Oh, you're being audited? What for?
Jerry: Oh, I contributed money to a charity that turned out to be fraudulent. 
It's very...
Elaine: When was this?
Jerry: Uh, a long, long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away.
Elaine: I remember you donated to some volcano thing on our first date.
Jerry: Volcano? Really?
Elaine: Oh, wait a minute. Don't tell me that that was ...
Jerry: Something to drink?
Elaine: What did you think, that would impress me?
Jerry: You got it all wrong. I was thinking only of the poor Krakatoans.
Elaine: Like you make this donation for 50 bucks and I'd start tearing my 
clothes off?
Jerry: Those brave Krakatoans East of Java. who sacrificed so much for so long.
Elaine: Now you're being audited because of it. You see that's Karma.
Jerry: No, that's Kramer.
%
Jerry: What did you tell her?
George: I told her that she was pretentious.
Jerry: Pretentious? The woman has my tax papers. You told her she was 
pretentious? The IRS — they're like the Mafia. They can take anything they 
want.

Jerry: On my block, a lot of people walk their dogs, and I always see them 
walking along with their little poop bags, which to me is just the lowest 
function of human life. If aliens are watching this through telescopes, they're 
gonna think the dogs are the leaders. If you see two life forms, one of them's 
making a poop, the other one's carrying it for him, who would you assume was in 
charge?

Librarian: Yes?
Jerry: Yes I called before. I got this notice in the mail.
Librarian: Oh, Tropic of Cancer, Henry Miller, Uh, this case has been turned

Librarian: It's true.
Kramer: That's amazing. That's like an ice cream man named "Cone."

Bookman: You took this book out in 1971.
Jerry: Yes, and I returned it in 1971.
Bookman: Yeah, '71. That was my first year on the job. Bad year for libraries. 
Bad year for America. Hippies burning library cards, Abby Hoffman telling 
everybody to steal books. I don't judge a man by the length of his hair or the 
kind of music he listens to. Rock was never my bag. But you put on a pair of 
shoes when you walk into the New York Public Library, fella...
Jerry: Look, Mr. Bookman. I--I returned that book. I remember it very 
specifically.
Bookman: You're a comedian, you make people laugh.
Jerry: I try.
Bookman: You think this is all a big joke, don't you?
Jerry: No, I don't.
Bookman: I saw you on TV once; I remembered your name--from my list. I looked 
it up. Sure enough, it checked out. You think because you're a celebrity that 
somehow the law doesn't apply to you, that you're above the law?
Jerry: Certainly not.
Bookman: Well, let me tell you something, funny boy. Y'know that little stamp, 
the one that says "New York Public Library"? Well that may not mean anything to 
you, but that means a lot to me. One whole hell of a lot. Sure, go ahead, laugh 
if you want to. I've seen your type before: Flashy, making the scene, flaunting 
convention. Yeah, I know what you're thinking. What's this guy making such a 
big stink about old library books? Well, let me give you a hint, junior. Maybe 
we can live without libraries, people like you and me. Maybe. Sure, we're too 
old to change the world, but what about that kid, sitting down, opening a book, 
right now, in a branch at the local library and finding drawings of pee-pees 
and wee-wees on the Cat in the Hat and The Five Chinese Brothers? Doesn't he 
deserve better? Look. If you think this is about overdue fines and missing 
books, you'd better think again. This is about that kid's right to read a book 
without getting his mind warped! Or maybe that turns you on, Seinfeld; maybe 
that's how y'get your kicks. You and your good-time buddies. Well I got a flash 
for ya, joy-boy: Party time is over. Y'got seven days, Seinfeld. That is one 
week!

Jerry: I've had this condition since I was eleven! I've been in and out of 
hospitals my whole life. I have no control over it. Doctors have told me that 
when I feel it, the best thing to do is just release it. Otherwise, I could die.
Security Guard: Well you're still not allowed.
Jerry: Do you hear what I'm saying to you?! I'm telling you that if I don't go, 
I could die. Die. Is it worth dying for?
Security Guard: That's up to you.
Jerry: So you don't care if I die.
Security Guard: What I care about is the sanitary condition of the parking 
facility.
Jerry: It was life and death.
Security Guard: Uh huh.
Jerry: Oh I'm lying. Why would I do it unless I was in mortal danger? I know 
it's against the law.
Security Guard: I don't know.
Jerry: Because I could get Uromysitisis poisoning and die. That's why!...Do you 
think I enjoy living like this?...the shame, the humiliation...You know I have 
been issued a public urination pass by the city because of my condition. 
Unfortunately my little brother ran out of the house with it this morning. Him 
and his friends are probably peeing all over the place.

Elaine: [about driving them around to find the lost car] Why can't you do it?
Man: I can't.
Elaine: No, see that's not a reason you can't. You just don't want to.
Man: That's right.
Elaine: But why? Why don't you want to?
Man: I don't know.
Elaine: But wouldn't you get any satisfaction out of helping someone out?
Man: No, I wouldn't.
%
Elaine: Why do you keep watching?
Jerry: I don't know. I'm obsessed with it. It's like a spider in the toilet 
struggling for survival. And even if you know it's not going to make it, you 
kind of root for it for a second.
Elaine: And then you flush.
Jerry: Well, it's a spider.

George: 85, Jerry! 85 IQ !
[Jerry laughs.]
Elaine: 85?
Jerry: Well, well, well...
Elaine: He's coming up?
Jerry: Well, I'm no genius, but according to my calculations he should be here 
in a few seconds.
Elaine: Yeah, but an 85, that's ridiculous.
Jerry: Well, maybe the test was gender bias, you know a lot of questions about 
hunting and testicles...
[George comes in looking angry.]
George: Oh, hello professor.
Elaine: George, I cannot believe...
George: Please...
Elaine: No there has got be a mistake.
George: You should've seen her face. It was the exact same look my father gave 
me when I told him I wanted to be a ventriloquist.
Jerry: But an 85?
Elaine: There were too many distractions there. Babu...what ever he's name was 
and Kramer...I couldn't concentrate.
Jerry: It was a madhouse.
%
George: What do the Chinese have to gain by faking a cure for baldness?
Jerry: If it was real, they would never let it out of the country. No baldness, 
it'd be like a nation of Supermen.

Elaine: [jokingly] Jerry, I want to slide my tongue around you like a snake... 
Ooooooooooha, oooooohaaaa...
%
George: [referring to a nose job] Not that I care, one way or the other, but 
these doctors today really do amazing things, you know, if you were so 
inclined. And again, I'm not suggesting.
Audrey: I know, they're good.
George: Peter Jennings had one.
Audrey: Really?
George: Probably. They all do. In my high school, half my graduating class had 
them. Of course, I'm from Long Island, so...
%
Jerry: I have never been so repulsed by someone mentally and so attracted to 
them physically at the same time. It's like my penis is facing my brain is a 
chess match. And I'm letting him win.
George: You're not letting him win. He wins till you're forty.
Jerry: Then what?
George: He still wins but it's not a blowout.
%
George: I don't like when a woman says, 'Make love to me', it's intimidating. 
The last time a woman said that to me, I wound up apologizing to her.
Jerry: Really?
George: That's a lot of pressure. Make love to me. What am I, in the circus? 
What if I can't deliver?
Jerry: Oh, come on.
George: I can't perform under pressure. That's why I never play anything for 
money, I choke. I could choke tonight. And she works in my office, can you 
imagine? She goes around telling everyone what happened? Maybe I should cancel, 
I have a very bad feeling about this.
Jerry: George, you're thinking too much.
George: I know, I know, I can't stop it!
%
Elaine: [about Eva's fur] You don't care that innocent defenseless animals are 
being tortured so that you can look good?
George: Could we talk about this some other time?
Ava: Are you a vegetarian?
Jerry: Here we go...
Elaine: Yeah, I eat fish occasionally.
Ava: So you're a hypocrite.
George: Hey, I've eaten frogs, so nobody's perfect.
%
Agent: I'm sorry, we have no mid-size available at the moment.
Jerry: I don't understand, I made a reservation, do you have my reservation?
Agent: Yes, we do, unfortunately we ran out of cars.
Jerry: But the reservation keeps the car here. That's why you have the 
reservation.
Agent: I know why we have reservations.
Jerry: I don't think you do. If you did, I'd have a car. See, you know how to 
take the reservation, you just don't know how to hold the reservation and 
that's really the most important part of the reservation, the holding. Anybody 
can just take them.
%
Sid: Now you didn't tell me you didn't know how to drive. You should have 
mentioned that.
George: Well I know how to drive.
Sid: Then how'd all those cars get damaged? Why are people calling me up 
screaming on the phone? Most of them cancelled out on me.
Jerry: Can I get anybody anything?
Sid: Moving cars from one side of the street to the other don't take no more 
sense than putting on a pair of pants. My question to you is who's putting your 
pants on?
George I put my pants on, Sid.
Sid: I don't believe you. If you can put your pants on, you can move those cars.
George: Well I don't want to get into a big dispute about the pants.
%
Mr. Lippman: It has come to my attention that you and the cleaning woman have 
engaged in sexual intercourse on the desk in your office. Is that correct?
George: Who said that?
Mr. Lippman: She did.
George: Was that wrong? Should I not have done that? I'm sorry, I'm gonna have 
to plead ignorance on this thing, because if I had known that sort of thing was 
frowned upon...
%
Elaine: George, this is one of the nicest things anyone has ever given me!
George: Well, good, good. Take it off. You're going to wear it out already. 
It's for special occasions this thing.
Kramer: What's that red dot on your sweater?
%
Kramer: All right, Coney Island. Okay, you can take the B or the F and switch 
for the N at Broadway Lafayette, or you can go over the bridge to DeKalb and 
catch the Q to Atlantic Avenue, then switch to the IRT 2, 3, 4 or 5, but don't 
get on the G. See, that's very tempting, but you wind up on Smith and 9th 
street, then you got to get on the R.
Elaine: Couldn't he just take the D straight to Coney Island?
Kramer: Well, yeah...
%
Jerry: Remember, don't whistle on the elevator.
George: Why not?
Jerry: That's what Willy Loman told Biff before his interview in Death of a 
Salesman.
George: What, you are comparing me to Biff Loman? Very encouraging: the biggest 
loser in history of American literature.
%
Jerry: Anyone who would laugh at a recital is probably some sort of lunatic 
anyway. I mean, only a sick, twisted mind could be that rude and ignorant.
Elaine: Well, maybe some mental defective put something stupid on her leg.
Jerry: Even if this so-called mental defective did put something on her leg, 
she's still the one who laughed.

juicy, tender breasts of duck.

Malaria? Yellow fever? Lupus? Is it lupus?!

George: Is there a pinkish hue?
Jerry: A pinkish hue?
George: Yeah, a rosy glow.
Jerry: There's a hue. She's got great eyebrows; women kill to have her eyebrows.
George: Who cares about eyebrows?
%
George: What kind of hair?
Jerry: You know: long, dark hair.
George: Flowing?
Jerry: Flowing?
George: Is it flowing? I like flowing, cascading hair. Thick, lustrous hair is 
very important to me.
Jerry: "Thick, lustrous hair is very important to me." Is that what you said?
George: Yeah, that's right.
Jerry: Just clarifying.
%
Jerry: According to your story, Hernandez passes you and starts walking up the 
ramp. Then you say you were struck on the right temple. The spit then proceeds 
to ricochet off the temple, striking Newman between the third and fourth rib. 
The spit then came off the rib turned and hit Newman in the right wrist, 
causing him to drop his baseball cap. The spit then splashed off the wrist, 
pauses — in mid air, mind you — makes a left turn and lands on Newman's 
left thigh. That is one magic loogie.
...
Jerry: I'm saying that the spit could not have come from behind, that there had 
to have been a second spitter, behind the bushes on the gravelly road. If the 
spitter was behind you as you claim, that would've caused your head to pitch 
forward.
Elaine: So the spit could've only come from the front and to the right.
Jerry: But that's not what they would have you believe.
Newman: I'm leavin.' Jerry's a nut!
Kramer: [to Newman] Wait, wait, wait.
Jerry: The sad thing is that we may never know the real truth.
%
Kramer: [on phone] Yello? What-delay Industries?
George: [in the bathroom] VANDELAY! SAY VANDELAY!
Kramer: [Elaine tries to interrupt Kramer, but he keeps ignoring her] No, 
you're way, way off! Well, yeah, that's the right number, but this is an 
APARTMENT!
[George bursts out of the bathroom, his pants down around his ankles]
George: VANDELAY! SAY- [Falls down next to Kramer] SAY VANDELAY INDUSTRIES!
Kramer: Yeah, no problem. No problem. [Hangs up and looks at George, who is 
lying despondently on the floor] How did you know who they wanted?
[Jerry walks in and sees George laying on the floor, his pants down]
Jerry: And you want to be my latex salesman...

Keith Hernandez: [thinking] Come on, I won the MVP in '79. I can do whatever I

George: Kind of a cute Nazi, though.

Eva: What was that you said about the myth of the Holocaust?
George: Oh, I said so many things. I- [a loud blast is heard] They're shooting! 
They're shooting!

special.

Art patron: [describing his view of "The Kramer" portrait] He is a loathsome, 
offensive brute. Yet I can't look away.

George: No, it always has to be explained to me, and then I have to have 
someone explain the explanation.

George: All bald people look good in hats.
Elaine: You should have lived in the twenties and thirties. You know, men wore 
hats all the time then.
George: What a bald paradise that must have been. Nobody knew.
%
Jerry: Like you didn't call me a phony?
Mike: What? [to Kramer] Thanks! Real good! [back to Jerry] Jerry! First of all, 
I think you completely misunderstood what I said. I meant it in a complimentary 
way. I mean, you know when people say, "He's bad," it really means he's good, 
sort of thing? You know, slang.
Jerry: Use it in a sentence.
Mike: Man, that Michael Jordan is so phony. [to Kramer] Why'd you tell him?
Kramer: He begged me!
Mike: He begged you?
%
Kramer: Do you ever yearn?
George: Yearn? Do I yearn?
Kramer: I yearn.
George: You yearn?
Kramer: Oh, yes. Yes, I yearn. Often I sit... and yearn. Have you yearned?

yearned.

Jerry: Hello 911? How are you?
%
Telemarketer: Hi, would you be interested in switching over to TMI long 
distance service.
Jerry: Oh, gee, I can't talk right now. Why don't you give me your home number 
and I'll call you later.
Telemarketer: Uh, I'm sorry we're not allowed to do that.
Jerry: Oh, I guess you don't want people calling you at home.
Telemarketer: No.
Jerry: Well now you know how I feel. [hangs up]

Kramer: No. We had a deal. There are no guarantees in life.
Newman: No, but there's karma, Kramer.
Jerry: "Karma Kramer"?
%
Newman: So I sped home to save my friend's life and I was stopped for speeding. 
Yes, I admit I was speeding but it was to save a man's life! A close friend. An 
innocent person who wanted nothing more out of life than to love, to be loved 
and to be a banker.
%
Jerry: You know a muffin can be very filling.
%
Jerry: Don't you hate "To be continued" on TV? It's horrible when you sense the 
"To be continued" coming. You know, you're watching the show; you're into the 
story. There's, like, five minutes left and suddenly you realize, "Hey, they 
can't make it. Timmy's still stuck in the cave. There's no way they wrap this 
up in five minutes." I mean, the whole reason you watch a TV show is because it 
ends. If I want a long, boring story with no point to it, I have my life. A 
comedian can't do that, see. I can't go, "A man walks into a bar with a pig 
under his arm... Can you come back next week?"
%
Morty: They stole my wallet. The bum stole my wallet. MY WALLET'S GONE! MY 
WALLET'S GONE! I had my wallet in my back pocket. It’s gone.

that the operation here?

Elaine: Just tell him that you're my boyfriend and that we're in love, okay. 
Can you do that?
Kramer:Yeah, yeah, okay. I'm your boyfriend... Have we been intimate?
Elaine: Yeah, yeah, we've been intimate.
Kramer: How often do we do it?
Elaine: Kramer, how is that important? Honestly, do you really think he's gonna 
ask you that?
Kramer: Elaine, he's a psychiatrist. They're interested in stuff like that.
Elaine: Alright, alright. We do it, uh...five times a week, okay?
Kramer: Oooh, baby.

Helen: If you don't think she's beautiful, there's something wrong with you.

Leo: She's alright..

Naomi: I thought you liked to laugh. I thought you were happy-go-lucky.
Jerry: No, nah. I'm not happy and I'm not lucky, and I don't go. If anything 
I'm sad stop unlucky.
Naomi: Hahahaha.
Jerry: That's not funny, Naomi. I didn't mean to be funny there. Why don't you 
check the TV guide. I think uh, Holocaust is on.

they're all "laid out for me".

Jerry: I kinda like this opera crowd. I feel tough. Anybody else got a problem?
%
Elaine: I was talking to this guy, you know, and I just happened to throw my 
purse on the sofa and my diaphragm goes flying out. So I just froze, you know, 
"ahh!", staring at my diaphragm. You know, it's just lying there. So then, this 
woman, the one who sold me this hair thing, she grabbed it before the guy 
noticed. So, I mean, big deal, right? So I carry around my diaphragm; who 
doesn't? Yeah, like it's a big, big secret that women carry around their 
diaphragms. You never know when you're gonna need it, right?
%
Jerry: She's a virgin. I just found out.
Elaine: Well, I didn't know!
Jerry: Well, it's not like spotting a toupee.
%
George: Hey, what are you doing tonight?
Jerry: Dating Marla.
George: Oh, the virgin?
Jerry: Yeah.
George: Any, uh.. progress, there? What's the latest?
Jerry: Well, I got my troops amassed along the border - I'm just waiting for 
someone to give me the go-ahead.
%
Elaine: What're you looking at?
Jerry: There's a naked woman across the street.
Elaine: [chuckling] This is gonna be the easiest money I've ever made in my 
life. So, my friend, Joyce, is teaching an aerobics class. I'm gonna go tonight.
Jerry: Yeah.. the - the waitress should've taken it back.
Elaine: So then, I got a call this morning. You know, I was, uh, chosen to go 
on the space shuttle. We're goin' to Mars.
Jerry: Uh-huh.
George: Have a good time.

Kramer: Listen to the bell, Grossbard. It tolls for thee.

Guard: All right, let's go.
Prisoner: I want the magazine!
George: Umm... No.
Prisoner: You know what I would do to you, if I wasn't in these shackles..
George: But you are, "Blanche"! You are in the shackles. Oh, I can't wait to 
read my "Time" magazine! Last copy, too. Maybe I'll read it tomorrow in the 
park! It's supposed to be a beautiful day! Have a nice life..sentence, that is!

Jerry: If we pick, do we not bleed?
%
Jerry: I am not an animal!
%
Elaine: I don't wanna go to a miniplex multi-theater!
George: It's the same movie! What's the difference?
Elaine: It's not a theater, it's like a room where they bring in P.O.W.s to 
show them propaganda films.
%
George: Hey, you know what else is playing here? "Rochelle Rochelle."
Elaine: Ugh.
George: I wouldn't mind seeing that.
Elaine: Yeah, you know, men can sit through the most boring movie if there's 
even the slightest possibility that a woman will take her top off.
George: So what's your point?
%
Jerry: Well, birthdays are merely symbolic of how another year's gone by and 
how little we've grown. No matter how desperate we are that someday a better 
self will emerge, with each flicker of the candles on the cake we know it's not 
to be. That for the rest of our sad, wretched, pathetic lives, this is who we 
are to the bitter end. Inevitably, irrevocably. Happy birthday? No such thing.
%
George: I'm disturbed, I'm depressed, I'm inadequate, I've got it all!
%
Jerry: Looking at a cleavage is like looking at the sun. You don't stare at it. 
It's too risky. You get a sense of it and then you look away.
%
Jerry: Men are obsessed with cleavage. It doesn't matter how many times we've 
seen these things. Every time these objects are presented to us, we have to 
look. We cannot not look. To men, cleavage is like the nearest thing to a 
nearby UFO landing. That's what it is.
%
Jerry: I've been outed. I wasn't even in!
%
Jerry: Everyone thinks we're gay!... Not that there's anything wrong with that.
%
Sid: Oh her. She steals from me. Steals my money. She says she doesn't speak 
English. My ass she doesn't speak English. Plays that freakin' "voo-doo" music 
and tries to hypnotize me. She thinks she's gonna turn me into a zombie and 
then rob me blind. Well, I wasn't born yesterday. I may drop dead today, but I 
sure as hell wasn't born yesterday! Now get the hell out of my house!
%
George: Aren't [postal workers] the guys that always go crazy and come back 
with a gun and shoot everybody?
Newman: [ominously] Sometimes...
George: Why is that?
Newman: Because the mail never stops. It just keeps coming and coming and 
coming, there's never a let-up! It's relentless! Every day it piles up more and 
more and more! And you gotta get it out! But the more you get it out the more 
it keeps coming in! And then the bar code reader breaks! And it's Publisher's 
Clearing House day!
%
Sidra: And one more thing; they're real, and they're spectacular.
%
Elaine: You know, sometimes when I think you're the shallowest man I've ever 
met, you somehow manage to drain a little more out of the pool.
%
Kramer: Who's gonna turn down a Junior Mint? It's chocolate, it's peppermint; 
it's delicious!
Jerry: That's true.
Kramer: It's very refreshing!
%
George: I guess it can't hurt him... People eat pounds of those things.
Jerry: They eat them, they don't put them next to vital organs in their 
abdominal cavity!
%
George: This is beyond B.O. This is B.B.O.
%
Jerry: Usually the O stays with the B. Once the B is gone the O leaves with it.
%
Kramer: I got news for you: handicapped people, they don't even want to park 
there! They wanna be treated just like anybody else! That's why, those spaces 
are always empty.
George: He's right! It's the same thing with the feminists. You know, they want 
everything to be equal, everything! But when the check comes, where are they?
Elaine: What's that supposed to mean?
%
Salesman: This is our best model: The Cougar 9000. It's the Rolls Royce of 
wheelchairs. This is like...you're almost glad to be handicapped.
%
Jerry: Again with the sweat pants?
George: What? I'm comfortable.
Jerry: You know the message you're sending out to the world with these sweat 
pants? You're telling the world: "I give up. I can't compete in normal society. 
I'm miserable, so I might as well be comfortable."
%
George: He took a biopsy Jerry, a biopsy!
Jerry: What'd he say?
George: He said he didn't know what it was.
Jerry: All right, so?
George: When I asked him if it was cancer, he didn't give me a "get out of 
here". That's what I wanted to hear. "Cancer? Get out of here!"
Jerry: Maybe he doesn't have a "get out of here" kind of personality.
George: How could you be a doctor and not say "get out of here" ? It should be 
part of the training in medical school. "Cancer? Get out of here! Go home! What 
are you, crazy? It's a little test. It's nothing. You're a real nut, you know 
that?" Told you God would never let me be successful. I never should have 
written that pilot. Now the show will be a big hit, we'll make millions of 
dollars, and I'll be dead. Dead, Jerry. Because of this.
Jerry: Can't you at least die with a little dignity?
George: No I can't. I can't die with dignity. I have no dignity. I want to be 
the one person who doesn't die with dignity. I've lived my whole life in shame! 
Why should I die with dignity?
%
Sandi: You're breaking up with me, aren't you?
Jerry: Do you want me to break up with you?
Sandi: If that's what you want.
Jerry: I don't even know what you're talking about.
Sandi: Fine. Break up with me.
Jerry: All right. We're broken up.
Sandi: Can we still be friends?
%
George: You faked?
Elaine: On occasion.
Jerry: And the guy never knows?
Elaine: No.
Jerry: How can he not know that?
Elaine: Because I was gooood.
Jerry: I guess after that many beers he'd be pretty groggy anyway.
Elaine: [chuckles] You didn't know.

Elaine: Jerry, we have to have sex to save the friendship.
Jerry: Sex to save the friendship. [starts to take off his shirt] Well if we 
have to we have to.

Kramer: This isnt going to be a new look for the '90s. You're gonna be the 
first pirate!
Jerry: But I don't want to be a pirate!

Jerry: I have to wear it [the puffy shirt]! The people at the factory are 
making these based on me wearing it on TV! They're producing them as we speak!
Elaine: But you need to look like a compassionate person that cares about poor 
people! You look like you're gonna swing in on a chandelier!

[George enters, wearing swimming goggles instead of his glasses.]
George: I gotta get out of this city.
Jerry: So you're tunneling to the center of the earth?
George: I'm at the health club; and while I'm in the pool, some guy walks off 
with my glasses. Who steals prescription glasses?
Elaine: You don't have an old pair?
George: I broke 'em playing basketball.
Jerry: He was running from a bee.
%
Elaine: So I'm all right? I don't need a shot?
Doctor: Not shot. Dog bite.
Elaine: Yes, I know I wasn't shot. Do I need a shot?
Doctor: Not shot. Dog bite. Woof-woof. Not bang-bang.
%
Elaine: So because of a few bad apples, you're going to impugn an entire 
continent?
Jerry: Yes, I'm impugning a continent.
%
Frank: How long it takes to find a bra? What's going on in there? You ask me to 
get a pair of underwear, I'm back in two seconds...you know about the cup sizes 
and all? They have different cups.
George: I know about the cups.
Frank: You got the A, B, C the D. That's the biggest.
George: I know the D is the biggest. I've based my whole life on knowing that 
the D is the biggest.
%
George: [showing off his perfect parking spot to Elaine and Jerry] Maybe the 
baby would like to see the spot.
%
Kramer: I'm tellin' ya! The pigman is alive. The government's been 
experimenting with pigmen since the fifties.
Jerry: Will you stop it. Just because a hospital gets a grant to study DNA 
doesn't mean they are creating a race of mutant pigmen.
Kramer: Oh, Jerry. Would you wake up to reality! It's a military thing. They're 
probably creating a whole army of pig warriors.
%
[Gwen is breaking up with George]
Gwen: It's not you, it's me.
George: [appalled] You're giving me the "It's Not You, It's Me" routine? I 
invented "It's Not You, It's Me"! No one tells me it's them, not me! If it's 
anybody, it's me!
Gwen: [embarrassed] Alright, alright... George, it's you.
George: You're damn right, it's me!
%
Driver: I'm so sorry, you'll have to forgive me. I can't hear a damn thing. I 
went to that rock concert last night at the garden. My seats were right up 
against the speaker. It's a heavy metal group. "Metalli"-something.
Kramer: "Ca".
Driver: Huh?
George: Wha..?
Jerry: "Ca".
George: Ah.
%
Doctor: I find that there's absolutely nothing wrong with you.
George: Hmm. Really? Nothing?
Doctor: Nothing that would indicate involuntary spasms.
George: Well, it's kind of a mystery, isn't it?
Doctor: No, not really.
George: How so?
Doctor: May I suggest the possibility that you're faking?
%
Boy: (to Jerry) Thanks for ruining my daddy's business, you fat f*ck.
%
Enzo: You happy with the haircut?
Newman: It's okay. A little crooked.
Enzo: How'd you like to have free haircut for six months.
Newman: What's the catch?
Enzo: You're going to get me a sample of Jerry's hair.
Newman: That job sounds like it might be worth a year of free haircuts. And a 
comb.
%
Gino: So I love the Edward Scissorhands. That's the best movie I've ever seen.
Enzo: Ah, again with the Edward Scissorhands. How can you have hand like 
scissors, huh? Show me one person who's got hand like scissors!
Gino: Hey, it's a beautiful dream. I'd love to be this man.
Enzo: Did you ever think about what you're going to do on the toilet? What are 
you going to do on the toilet?
Kramer: I'd like to have shoehorn hands.
%
George: Jerry...this woman hates me so much...I'm starting to like her.
%
George: A woman that hates me this much comes along once in a lifetime.
Jerry: You're a lucky guy.

Kramer: I'm doing a coffee-table book on coffee tables.

Estelle Costanza: George doesn't work. He's a bum.
%
Father/Priest: Is there one aspect of the faith that you find particularly 
attractive?
George: I like the hats.
%
George: By Christmas Day, I will be Brother Costanza.
Jerry: And what does Brother Costanza plan on telling Mother Costanza?
George: Brother Costanza will be taking the vow of silence.
%
Jerry: You're crazy.
Kramer: Am I? Or am I so sane that you just blew your mind?
Jerry: It's impossible.
Kramer: Is it? Or is it so possible that your head is spinning like a top?
Jerry: It can't be.
Kramer: Can't it? Or is your entire world crashing down all around you?
%
Jerry: He's a male bimbo... He's a mimbo!
%
Jerry: Uh, I don't feel so good.
Elaine: What's wrong?
Jerry: My stomach, I , I think it was that cookie.
Elaine: The black and white?
Jerry: Yeah.
Elaine: Not getting along?

Man:[Bumps into George and angrily says] Big Coat!
George: Yes, Its a big coat!
Kramer: Be careful with that coat, you'll start a war!

[using the ATM at the same time as the person next to him]
Jerry: "Cash advance"? Yes... no. "Balance inquiry"? No. "Receipt"? No. 
Processing... processing... processing. [to the person next to him] I win!

George: The sea was angry that day, my friends, like an old man trying to send 
back soup at a deli!

Ricky's supervisor: Ricky, we've been getting a tremendous response to your 
TR-6 mannequin.
Ricky: TR-6? I prefer to think of her as... Elaine.
%
Jerry: A chef who doesn't wash his hands is like a cop who steals. It's a cry 
for help.
%
Jerry: How do you stop a kid from growing?
Kramer: I told you, you should offer him some cigarettes.
Mickey: I offered him cigarettes, but his stupid mother is hanging around. She 
won't let him have any.
%
George: Why don't they just hire another midget?
Mickey: It's "little people"...You got that?!
%
Kramer: Hey Elaine, what do you say, if neither of us is married in 10 years, 
we get hitched?
Elaine: Make it 50.
Kramer: We're engaged!
%
George: A guy leaves a puddle of sweat, that's a signal?
Elaine: Yeah, it's a social thing.
George: What if he left you a used Kleenex? What's that, a valentine?
%
Jerry: She lives with her parents.
George: Really? Maybe this will become like a cool thing, living with your 
parents.
Jerry: Yeah, then maybe baldness will catch on.
%
Jerry: [during stand-up] To me, the thing about birthday parties is that the 
first birthday party you have and the last birthday party you have are actually 
quite similar. You know, you just kinda sit there...you're the least excited 
person at the party. You don't even really realize that there is a party. You 
don't know what's goin' on. Both birthday parties, people have to kinda help 
you blow out the candles, you can't do it...you don't even know why you're 
doing it. What is this ritual?
%
George: What looked like pushing...what looked like knocking down...was a 
safety precaution! In a fire, you stay close to the ground, am I right? And 
when I ran out that door, I was not leaving anyone behind! Oh, quite the 
contrary! I risked my life making sure that exit was clear. Any other questions?
Fireman: How do you live with yourself?
George: It's not easy.
%
Kramer: Hey Jerry, you ever wear silk underwear?
Jerry: No.
Kramer: Put that on the top of your list.
Jerry: No, not for me. A little too delightful.
%
Elaine: Oh, isn't that weird that George and Jane haven't had sex yet, but 
they're spending a weekend together?
Jerry: I know, George is pretty pleased about it. It's like she signed a letter 
of intent.
%
Jerry: The New York Yankees?
George: The New York [turns Yankees hat around] Yankees!
Jerry: Ruth, Gehrig, DiMaggio, Mantle ... Costanza!?
%
George: SHUT YOUR TRAPS AND STOP KICKING THE SEATS! WE’RE TRYING TO WATCH THE 
MOVIE! And if I have to tell you again, we’re gonna take it outside and I'm 
gonna SHOW you what it's like, you understand me? Now shut your mouths or I’m 
gonna shut 'em for ya! And if you think I'm kidding, just try me. Try me! 
Because I would LOVE it!!!
%
Ms. Rhode Island: I'm watching my weight.
Jerry: I'm watching my height. My doctor doesn't want me to get any taller.
%
Kramer: Look, if you think I'm just going to step aside and do nothing while 
you defile this woman, you're crazy.
%
Jerry: People on dates shouldn't even be allowed out in public.
%
Jerry: He doesn't even care if a man answers.
Elaine: Or you.
%
Leo: She can't do that, she's on a very fixed income! Stop the show!!
%
Kramer: Your Nana is missing because she's been passing those bum checks all 
over town and she finally pissed off the wrong people!
%
Kramer: I need the secure packaging of Jockeys. My boys need a house!
%
Jerry: [referring to George] It's a shame his parents didn't get divorced 
thirty years ago. He could've been normal.
%
Jerry: Is it? C-could it? Could he have? It is! Poppy peed on my sofa!
%
Kramer: Jerry, you stand on the threshold to the magical world of sensual 
delights that most men dare not dream of.
%
Jerry: You're in the kitchen. You see an éclair in the receptacle. So you 
think to yourself, "What the hell, I'll just eat some trash."
%
Jerry: We should get you to a hospital.
Kramer: I ain't going to no Bellevue.
%
George: [singing] Everybody's talkin' at me... can't hear a word they're 
sayin'... just drivin' around in Jon Voight's car...

Elaine: Can I have a big salad?
Waitress: A big salad?
Elaine: You see...
George: [irritated] Just tell them what you want. They'll make it for you.
Elaine: It's a salad, only bigger, with lots of stuff in it.
Waitress: I can bring you two small salads.
Elaine: Could you put it in a big bowl?
Waitress: We don't have big bowls.
Elaine: All right, just get me a cup of decaf.
Waitress: We have Sanka.
%
Secretary: As you can see, my references are impeccable and I think I'd be a 
real asset here. My only concern is: I take care of my mother. Will there be 
many late nights?
George: I can't imagine any.
%
Jerry: You got no waist in that thing.
George: And your arms look like something in a kosher deli.
%
George: Do you ever just get down on your knees and thank God that you know me 
and have access to my dementia?
%
George: Do you realize in the entire history of western civilization no one has 
successfully accomplished the Roommate Switch? In the Middle Ages you could get 
locked up for even suggesting it!
Jerry: They did not have roommates in the middle ages!
George: Well, I'm sure at some point between the years 800 and 1200, somewhere, 
there were two women living together.
Jerry: The point is I intend to undertake this. And I'll do it with or without 
you. So if you're scared, if you haven't got the stomach for this, let's get it 
out right now! And I'll go on my own. If not, you can get on board and we can 
get to work! Now what's it going to be?
George: Alright, dammit, I'm in.
%
Lois: Would you be able to come all the way downtown during rush hour again?
Jerry: Well, I'd have to be Superman to do that, Lois.
%
Lois: So, you were the fastest kid in school.
Jerry: Faster than a speeding bullet, Lois.
%
Jerry: "I CHOSE NOT TO RUN!"
%
Elaine: He recycled this gift. He's a regifter.
%
Jerry: Oh, it's "Risk." It's a game of world domination being played by two 
guys who can barely run their own lives.
%
Jerry: Who is he not to talk to you about his life-threatening illness?
%
George: You think I tell Jerry everything? It's not like he's my wife.
%
George: Jerry, just remember, it's not a lie if you believe it.
%
[Talking about George's toupee]
Kramer: Its a perfect match.
Jerry: Are you kidding? I can spot that bird's nest two blocks away.
%
George: I love these people. You can't ask 'em questions. They're so mentally 
gifted that we mustn't disturb the delicate genius unless it's in the confines 
of an office. When huge sums of money are involved, then the delicate genius 
can be disturbed!
%
Jerry: How 'bout those Knicks?
Doorman: Oh, I see. On the sports page...
Jerry: Yeah.
Doorman: What makes you think I wasn't reading the Wall Street page? Oh, I 
know, because I'm the uneducated doorman.
%
Jerry: [dressed as a doorman] Hey, hey, wait a second. You live here?
Mr. Green: Of course I live here! I've lived here for twenty years. Now if you 
don't let me in, I'm going to call the police and have you arrested!

Jerry: [yells] You think you're better than me?

Jimmy: You know, Jimmy is pretty sweet on you.
Elaine: [thinks that Jimmy is another guy] Aaaaaahhh! He is?
Jimmy: Oh, yeah! Jimmy's been watching you. You're just Jimmy's type.

Jimmy: Jimmy's new in town. Jimmy... doesn't really know anyone.
Elaine: Oh! Well, I'd like to get to know him.
Jimmy: Jimmy would like to get to know you.

Jerry: You know what you're doing? You're turning into Jimmy.
George: George is getting UPSET!

George: [referring to a doodle of himself] I look like a troll!

Elaine: What's this, a drawing of Mr. Magoo?
Jerry: No, that's George.
%
Jerry: You know what a good mechanic is worth? You can't compare that to sex.
%
Estelle: Georgie, I'm a divorcee.
George: No, you're not a divorcee. You're just separated. You're — you're a 
"separatee."
Estelle: Well, I'm out there, George.
George: No, you're not out there.
Estelle: I am, too!
George: You're not out there! You can't be, because I am out there. And if I 
see you out there, there's not enough voltage in this world to electroshock me 
back into coherence!

Mr. Morgan: I suppose we all look alike to you, right Costanza?

Katie: Jerry, I don't want you to freak out.
Jerry: I'm freakin' out! I am freakin' out!
%
Jerry: Who are these nitwits that get on a plane with nothing to read? You know 
who these people are?
Elaine: Who?
Jerry: These are the people that want to talk to you. They got nothing else to 
do, why not disturb you?
Elaine: I will never understand people.
Jerry: They're the worst.
%
George: You can't have a relationship where one person says 'I love you,' and 
the other one says 'I'm hungry, let's get something to eat.'
Jerry: Unless you're married...
George: Now she thinks I'm one of these guys that loves her. Nobody wants to be 
with somebody that loves them!
Jerry: No, people hate that.
%
George: I watched "Beaches" on cable last night... give me a break.
Bette: Get some talent. Then you can mouth off.
%
Kramer: [on the phone] A turkey sandwich, a side of slaw... You want white meat 
or dark?
Bette: White meat.
Kramer: Yeah, white meat. And if I see one piece of dark meat on there, it's 
your ass, buster!
%
Susan: I just want you to know that I love your son very much.
Estelle: You do?
Susan: Yes.
Estelle: Really?
Susan: Yes.
Estelle: May I ask why?
%
Jerry: Well, you know, we were having dinner the other night, and she's got 
this strangest habit: she eats her peas one at a time. You've never seen 
anything like it. It takes her an hour to finish them. I mean, we've had dinner 
other times. I've seen her eat corn niblets, but she scooped them.
George: She scooped the niblets?
Jerry: Yes. That's what was so vexing.
%
Kramer: Look at this, Jerry. That's littering.
Jerry: Maybe you better call the cops and turn me in.
Kramer: Maybe I will.
%
Susan: If you don't want to marry me, George, just say so. [crying] Say so.
George: Still marry. Still marry.
Susan: No, you don't love me.
George: No. Still love. Still love.
Susan: My parents told me you were too neurotic and that I was making a mistake.
George: No, no, no. No mistake, no mistake!

Kramer: You know you hurt the Maestro's feelings.
Jerry: Oh what, because I didn't call him "Maestro"?
Kramer: That's right.
Jerry: Ya know, I feel a little funny calling somebody "Maestro."
Kramer: Why?
Jerry: Because it's a stupid thing to be called.
Kramer: Jerry, he's a conductor.
Jerry: Oh, conductor. He conducts the Policeman's Benevolent Association 
Orchestra.

Jerry: New shirt?
George: Yeah. You like it?
Jerry: No, not particularly.
George: Why, the color?
Jerry: Yeah.
George: Too flashy?
Jerry: Yeah, it's burning my retina.

Kramer: Oh, by the way, tomorrow night Paul O'Neill has to catch a fly ball in 
his hat.
%
George: Right now, I sit around pretending that I'm busy.
Jerry: How do you pull that off?
George: I always look annoyed. Yeah, when you look annoyed all the time, people 
think that you're busy. Think about it... [puts on an annoyed face]
Elaine: Yeah, you do! He looks very busy!
Jerry: Yeah, he looks busy! Yeah!
George: I know what I'm doin.' In fact Mr. Wilhelm gave me one of those little 
stress dolls. All right, back to work. [puts on the annoyed face]
%
George: Hey, you bastards.
Jerry: Hey, how was the meeting?
George: I really like those sons of bitches.
Jerry: Sons of bitches?
George: Yeah! That's how they talk. You know, everyone's either a bastard or a 
son of a bitch. Yeah, it's like, uh... "Boy, that son of a bitch Boggs can 
really hit, huh?"
Jean-Paul: Really?
George: Yeah, yeah. That's how they talk in the Major League.

George: I didn't get any bread.

Elaine: Hello.
Soup Nazi: You. You think you can get soup? Please. You're wasting everyone's 
time.
Elaine: I don't want soup. I can make my own soup. "Five cups chopped Porcine 
mushrooms, half a cup of olive oil, three pounds celery."
Soup Nazi: [aghast] That is my recipe for wild mushroom [tries to grab the 
recipe].
Elaine: Yeah, that's right. I got 'em all. Cold cucumber, corn and crab 
chowder, mulligatawny..
Soup Nazi: Mulliga... tawny?
Elaine: You're through, Soup Nazi. Now pack it up. No more soup for you. NEXT!

door down. Please select now.

Jerry: She's too good.
George: Too good?
Jerry: I mean, she's giving and caring and genuinely concerned about the 
welfare of others. I can't be with someone like that.

Elaine: I just couldn't decide if he was really sponge worthy.

Frank: What is this thing, anyway?
Mrs. Ross: It's Cornish game hen.
Frank: What is that? Like a little chicken?
George: It's, uh, it's not a little chicken. [laughs] "Little chicken." It's a 
game bird.
Frank: Game bird?
George: Yeah.
Frank: What do you mean? Like, you hunt it?
Mr. Ross: Yes...
Frank: How hard could it be to kill this thing?
%
Frank: Let me understand. You got the hen, the chicken and the rooster. The 
rooster goes with the chicken. So, who's having sex with the hen?
George: Why don't we talk about it another time?
Frank: But you see my point here? You only hear of a hen, a rooster and a 
chicken. Something's missing!
Mrs. Ross: Something's missing all right.
Mr. Ross: They're all chickens. The rooster has sex with all of them.
Frank: That's perverse!

Ken: What?
George: Soda. S-O-D-A. Soda.
Carrie: I don't know, it sounds a little strange.

Jack: I don't feel like taking a ride. Do I have to take a ride?

Newman: Look, sister, go get yourself a cup of coffee, all right? Beat it! 
[pushes Elaine out the door and closes it] All right, now here's the lowdown. 
Through a certain connection, I've been able to locate some black market shower 
heads. They're all made in the former Yugoslavia. And from what I hear, the 
Serbs are fanatic about their showers.
Jerry: Not from the footage I've seen.

Peterman: Elaine, you've tested positive for opium.
Elaine: What?
Peterman: That's right, Elaine. White lotus. Yam-yam. Shanghai Sally!
...
Peterman: I know what you're going through. I too once fell under the spell of 
opium. It was 1979. I was traveling the Yangtzee in search of a Mongolian 
horsehair vest. I had got to the market after sundown. All of the clothing 
traders had gone, but a different sort of trader still lurked about. "Just a 
taste" he said. That was all it took.
Elaine: Mr. Peterman, I don't know what's going on here. I am not addicted to 
anything.
Peterman: Oh, Elaine, the toll road of denial is a long and dangerous one. The 
price? Your soul. Oh, and by the way, you have till 5:00 to clear out your 
desk. You're fired.

George: Susan has this doll collection, and one of the dolls looks exactly like 
my mother. She likes to sleep with it.

out, man.

Kramer: [snaps fingers] "The Place To Be!"
Frank: "The Place To Be!" Yes! It's the place to be.
%
Jerry: Excuse me. Excuse me. Are you asking him out?
Jessie: Yeah... I guess you could say that..
Jerry: Right in front of me! How do you know we're not together? Two guys 
sitting, laughing, drinking "Champagne Coolies."

Jerry: I'm telling you right now, Elaine, this guy's gonna dangle that dress in 
front of you like a dirt farmer dangles a carrot in front of a mule.

Kramer: Hey, buddy. I am waiting for my shirt.
Jerry: You got your shirt in my oven?
Kramer: I didn't have any quarters for the dryer. Anyway, this is better. And 
it's more convenient.
Jerry: [ironically] For both of us.
Kramer: And I have a lot more control. I have one shirt going for ten minutes 
at 325 degrees.
Jerry: What's wrong with your oven?
Kramer: I'm baking a pie!
%
Newman: It's the truck, Kramer. The truck!
Kramer: Look, Newman, I told you to let this thing go.
Newman: No, no, no, no no. Listen to me. Most days, the post office sends one 
truckload of mail to the second domestic regional sorting facility in Saginaw, 
Michigan.
Kramer: (interested) Uh-huh.
Newman: But, on the week before holidays, we see a surge. On Valentine's Day, 
we send two trucks. On Christmas, four, packed to the brim. And tomorrow, if 
history is any guide, will see some spillover into a fifth truck.
Kramer: (realization) Mother's Day.
Newman: The mother of all mail days. And guess who signed up for the truck.
Kramer: A free truck? Oh boy, that completely changes our cost structure. Our G 
and A goes down fifty percent.
Newman: (excited) We carry a couple of bags of mail, and the rest is ours!
Kramer: Newman, you magnificent bastard, you did it!
Newman: (triumph) Let the collecting begin!

George: Well[coughs] I can't stop now [coughs] I'm addicted... [coughing, 
wretching] they got a hold of me.
Susan: Well, you are gonna have to quit.
George: Oh, God! [runs to the bathroom]

George: I put a lot of thought into this, and I think I would like you to sign 
a prenuptial agreement.
Susan: A pre-nup?
George: Yeah. [Susan laughs] What's so funny?
Susan: Hahahaha... You don't have any money. I make more money than you do. 
Haha. Yeah, give me the papers. I'll sign 'em.

Jerry: It was unprecedented. I mean, it was the first truly mutual breakup in 
relationship history. No rejection, no guilt, no remorse.
Elaine: You've never felt remorse.
Jerry: I know. I feel bad about that.
%
Kramer: What's wrong?
Elaine: Oh, Peterman ran off to Burma and now he wants me to run the catalog.
Kramer: Where?
Jerry: Myanmar.

Her bouquet cleaved his hardened shell,
And fondled his muscled heart.
He imbibed her glistening spell,
Just before the other shoe fell.

Elaine: Jerry, George, Kramer. This is Kevin, Gene, and Feldman.
Jerry: This is really weird..

George: Have you ever seen Elaine dance?
Jerry: Elaine danced?!
George: It's more like a full-body dry heave set to music.
%
Frank: My son George isn't smart enough to hatch a scheme like this!
Elaine: You got that right.
Frank: What the hell does that mean?
Elaine: It means whatever the hell you want it to mean.
Frank: You sayin' you want a piece of me?
Elaine: I'd drop you like a sack of dirt.
Frank: You want a piece of me?! YOU GOT IT!!!
%
Jerry: What happened to my stereo? It's all smashed up.
Kramer: That's right. Now it looks like it was broken during shipping and I 
insured it for $400.
Jerry: But you were supposed to get me a refund.
Kramer: You can't get a refund. Your warranty expired two years ago.
Jerry: So were going to make the post office pay for my new stereo?
Kramer: It's just a write-off for them.
Jerry: How is it a write-off ?
Kramer: They just write it off.
Jerry: Write it off what?
Kramer: Jerry, all these big companies, they write off everything.
Jerry: You don't even know what a write-off is.
Kramer: Do you?
Jerry: No. I don't.
Kramer: But they do and they are the ones writing it off.
%
(Jerry is being investigated by Newman for mail-fraud)
Newman: Let me ask you this. Don't you find it interesting that your friend had 
the foresight to purchase postal insurance for your stereo? I mean parcels are 
rarely damaged during shipping.
Jerry: Define "rarely".
Newman: Frequently.
%
Bania: Why do they call it Ovaltine? The mug is round. The jar is round. They 
should call it Roundtine. That's gold, Jerry! Gold!
%
Kramer: You know Frank, you could take a break.
Frank: No breaks. I feel reborn. I'm like a Phoenix rising from Arizona.

Jerry: [pointing toward the guy] See that salesman, twirling that umbrella.
Elaine: Uh huh.
Jerry: I invented that.
%
Jerry: Broccoli? Newman, you wouldn't eat broccoli if it was deep-fried in 
chocolate sauce!
Newman: I love broccoli. It's... good for you.
Jerry: Then maybe you'd like to try a piece?
Newman: Gladly. [chews broccoli, then spits it out] VILE WEED!
Jerry: I knew it! The greasy doorknob, the constant licking of the fingers! 
Kramer did this! He's hooked on the chicken! He set you up, didn't he?
Newman: [desperately] Yes! Now, please, honey mustard! [takes a shot of the 
mustard, pounds his hand on the counter twice and exhales]
%
Mrs. Wilky: We feel that Mr. Kramer projects a rugged masculinity.
Jackie Chiles: Rugged? The man’s a goblin. He's only been exposed to smoke 
for four days! By the time this case gets to trial, he'll be nothin' more than 
a shrunken head.
%
Jerry: You had more bread?
Elaine: That's not the point. I mean, think about it, Jerry. There must be 
something exciting about this guy if he can arouse that kind of passion. I 
mean, to be stab-worthy, you know? It's kind of a compliment.
Jerry: Yeah, too bad he didn't get shot. He could have been the one.
%
George: I was handcuffed to the bed, in my underwear, where I remained for 
[…] She certainly seemed interested in me and though she was attractive, she 
was also in fact, a Nazi […] The water I had been swimming in was very cold 
and when I dropped the towel there had been significant shrinkage […] Her 
parents were looking at me. So there I was, with a marble rye hanging from the 
end of a fishing pole […] In closing, these stories have not been embellished 
because they need no embellishment. They are simply, horrifyingly the story of 
my life as a short, stocky, slow-witted, bald man. Thank you. Oh, also: my 
fiancée died from licking toxic envelopes that I picked out. Thanks again.

George: 20 years... that long?

George: Unfortunately, yes.
Jerry: How's your family history?
George: I have an aunt that died at age seven.
Jerry: Really?
George: Aunt Baby.

George: Listen to the comeback: "Oh yeah? Well the jerk store called. They're 
running outta you."
[Jerry, Elaine, and Kramer stare blankly at him]
George: Wha...You gotta be kidding me?!
Elaine: How 'bout this one? How 'bout, "Your cranium called. It's got some 
space to rent."?
George: What does that mean?
Jerry: Hey, here you go: "Hey, Reilly. The zoo called. You're due back by six."
George: No. No, no, no. You're not helping me.
Kramer: Look, just tell him you had sex with his wife. That'll kill him.
%
Reilly: The ocean called. They're running outta shrimp.
George: Oh yeah, Reilly? Well, the jerk store called. They're running outta you!
Reilly: What's the difference? You're their all-time best seller!

George isn't at home.
Please leave a message at the beep.
I must be out, or I'd pick up the phone,
Where could I be?
Believe it or not, I'm not home.

Lisa: How could you not love that movie?
Elaine: How about, it sucked?
%
Hal: I threw my back out about 15 years ago. Ever since I have been very 
careful. I only buy furniture in the ergonomics store.
Elaine: Oh those places have the stupidest names. Like, uh, "Back In Business", 
or "Good Vertibrations".
Hal: Not this one. It's called the "Lumbar Yard".

father beside him]
Father: Over there, that's Brooklyn . That's where Spike Lee lives.
Son: Hey, there's a man swimming in the water.

someone they throw the body in the river.
%
Elaine: I've yada yada'd sex.
George: Really?
Elaine: Yeah. I met this lawyer, we went out to dinner, I had the lobster 
bisque, we went back to my place, yada yada yada, I never heard from him again.
Jerry: But you yada yada'd over the best part.
Elaine: No, I mentioned the bisque.

[The phone rings.]
Jerry: Hello?
Telemarketer: Would you be interested in a subscription to The New York Times?
Jerry: Yes. [hangs up]
%
Jerry: Good meeting?
George: There was no meeting. But it was quite a meeting. You are looking at 
the next director of Mets scouting. The only thing is, I have to get fired from 
the Yankees first.
Jerry: You can do that.
George: Of course. But I really wanna leave my mark this time. You know, uh, I 
wanna walk away from the Yankees with people saying "Wow! Now that guy got 
canned!"
%
George: Attention, Steinbrenner and front office morons: your triumphs mean 
nothing. You all stink. You can sit on it and rotate!
%
George: When do you start to worry about ear hair?
Jerry: When you hear like a soft rustling.
%
Jerry: So you're pretending to be a tourist?
George: It's beautiful. She makes all the plans. I'm not from around here, so 
it's okay if I'm stupid. And she knows I'm only in town visiting, so there's no 
messy breakups.

George: I hereby declare this summer the summer of George!

George: Severance package...The Yankees are giving me three months full pay for 
doing nothing.

Dean Jones: I've been reviewing Darren's internship journal. Doing laundry, 
mending chicken wire, high tea with a Mr. Newman?
Kramer: Well, it all sounds pretty glamorous, but it's business as usual at 
Kramerica.
Dean Jones: Far as I can tell, your entire enterprise is little more than a 
solitary man with a messy apartment which may or may not contain a chicken.
Kramer: And with Darren's help, we'll get that chicken!
%
Jerry: So, what’s going on?
George: Siege mentality, Jerry. They really want me out of here. They’ve 
downgraded me to some sort of a bunker. I’m like Hitler’s last days here.
Jerry: So, are you going to leave?
George: Oh, no! I’m vigilant. They’ll never get me out. I’m like a weed, 
Jerry.
Jerry: I thought you’re like Hitler in the bunker?
George: I’m a weed in Hitler’s bunker.
Jerry: I’m getting a little uncomfortable with the Hitler stuff.
%
Frank: Serenity now! Serenity now!
George: What is that?
Frank: Doctor gave me a relaxation cassette. When my blood pressure gets too 
high, the man on the tape tells me to say "Serenity now!"
George: Are you supposed to yell it?
Frank: The man on the tape wasn't specific.
%
Jerry: Hello? Yeah, this is Jerry Seinfeld. No, no, no, I do not want to stop 
over in Cincinnati. Well, then you upgrade me. That's right, you should thank 
me. Goodbye. [Hangs up] Hey, I'm flyin' first class.

Jerry: Patty showed me how to get mad. You gotta problem with that?
Elaine: [intimidated] No.
Jerry: Good.

Kramer: Anyway, you're lucky I was there. You lost a lot of blood.
Jerry: (nervous) ...What?
Kramer: Yeah. You got three pints of Kramer in ya, buddy!

%
Jerry: Well, the doctors say I got some more blood, so it looks like I owe you 
again.

Kramer: Yeah... backstage.
%
Jerry: I just think if you borrow my blender you should return it.
Kramer: Well what’s the difference -- Come on, we're like Cain and Able.
Jerry: Yeah, you know Cain slew Abel.
Kramer: No he didn’t. They were in business together… it was dry wall, or 
somethin’.
Jerry: Oh, no.
Kramer: All right then, what was it?
Jerry: Well I think Abel worked hard all summer harvesting his crops, while 
Cain just played in the field. Then when Winter came, Able had all the nuts; 
Cain had no nuts, so he killed him.
Kramer: The way I remember it, Cain, he was a successful doctor, but when he 
took this special formula, he became Mr. Abel.

Kramer: I've sliced meat so thin, you couldn't see it.

in the shower.

Kramer: Showering. How long does it take you?
Jerry: Ten minutes.
Kramer: Ten minutes? That's kooky talk. Hey Elaine, how long do you spend in 
the shower?
Elaine: Ten minutes.
Kramer: Let me smell you.
Elaine: All right. Whiff away.
Kramer: [after delicately sniffing Elaine] Uh... that's not bad at all.

Jerry: So, Puddy, this is a pretty good move for you, huh? No more "grease 
monkey".
David Puddy: I don't much care for that term.

injector.

David Puddy: Yeah, I saw that one. Uh... Koko.
Jerry: Yeah, Koko.
David Puddy: Right, Koko. That chimp's all right. High-five.

Kramer: Newman and I are reversing the peepholes on our door so you can see in.
Elaine: Why?
Newman: To prevent an ambush.
Kramer: Yeah, so now I can peek to see if anyone is waiting to jack me with a 
sock full of pennies.
Jerry: But then anyone can just look in and see you.
Kramer: Our policy is, we're comfortable with our bodies. You know, if someone 
wants to help themselves to an eyeful, well, we say "Enjoy the show."
%
Jerry: You've been hiding her from us. you must really like her?

George: What's that?
Jerry: It's a Wizard electronic organizer for my dad. I'm going to Florida for 
his birthday.
George: How much was it?
Jerry: Two hundred, but I'll tell him it's fifty. He doesn't care about the 
gift; he gets excited about the deal.
George: Where are you gettin' a Wizard for fifty dollars?
Jerry: Eh, I'll tell him I got it on the street. Maybe it's hot — that's his 
favorite.

Jerry: So Sophie gave me the "It's me" on the phone today.
Elaine: "It's me"? Isn't that a little premature?
Jerry: I thought so.
Elaine: She's not a me. I'm a me.
George: I'm against all "It's me's." So self-absorbed and egotistical. It's 
like those hip musicians with their complicated shoes!

Jerry: That guy: swarm, swarm!
%
Jerry: Hey, look at the high score. "G.L.C." George Louis Costanza. That's not 
you, is it?
George: Yes! 860,000. I can't believe it's still standing. No one has beaten me 
in, like, ten years.
Jerry: I remember that night.
George: Oh, I was UNSTOPPABLE! The perfect combination of Mountain Dew and 
mozzarella... just the right amount of grease on the joy stick...
Mario: Here's your pizza, pea brains.
Jerry: I think I remember why we stopped coming here.
%
George: Kramer, listen to me. I'm never gonna have a child. If I lose this 
"Frogger" high score, that's it for me.

Kramer: [on the phone] Hey, I'm on First and... First. How can the same street 
intersect with itself? I must be at the nexus of the universe.

Costanza".
Jerry: Is this the suicide talk or the nickname talk?

Jerry: [to audience] Oh, hello. Nine years: seems like a long time, doesn't it?

[Newman is begging Jerry to take him to Paris.]

mark my words, Seinfeld — your day of reckoning is coming, when an evil wind 
will blow through your little play world and wipe that smug smile off your 
face. And I'll be there in all my glory, watching, watching as it all comes 
crumbling down!

George: I think we have.
Jerry: Yeah, maybe we have.
