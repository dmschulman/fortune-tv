Bob: Tina, you're on the grill.
Tina: My crotch is itchy.
Gene & Louise: Eww.
Bob: Ok. Are you telling me as my daughter or as my grill cook?
Tina: Umm... As...
Bob: Because my grill cook would never tell me that.
Tina: [Downcast] Oh.
Bob: Also, my daughter should probably not say anything like that to me. Tell her, tell your mom.
Tina: [Turns to Linda] My crotch is itchy.

Tina: Frowny face? All I've been is super nice to you and this is the thanks I get? I loved you, I loved you like a horse, which is my favorite animal. You know what, let's just stop before we both say something we'll regret, like that horses are better than cows. I regret that, but it's true.
%
Louise: So you're not going to get revenge today?
Bob: No, Louise, I'm not.

Gene: It's true.
Bob: Wait, you read her diary?

Linda: Ten years, Bob. TEN YEARS.
Hugo: [sarcastic] You're really living the dream, Linda!

Linda: Alright girls! Go girls!

Linda: [worried] They're not here! I got Tina's diary, let's see if it says anything. [reads diary] "Dear Diary, tonight we're sneaking into the dangerous taffy factory. Also, if boys had uteruses they'd be called duderuses".

Louise: Ignore it? I named it. Jezebel.
Linda: Awwww. My little grandoody.
%
Linda: You were right, Bob. I needed to let my baby birds fly. My bratty, little baby birds fly with their crappy little wings. Sometimes you gotta push 'em out the window.
Bob: Yeah.
Linda: You gotta just push 'em right out there and if they fall flat [slaps hands together] then that's them.
%
Linda: I had the video game company take your game away because I love you. It's like the time you took away the credit card from me when I was ordering all those porcelain babies.

When you get into an elevator with a woman, press a higher number than her and then make a big deal about it.
Push her in a lake.
Be one of the tallest guys in the bar and brag about how long your butt-crack is.
Sing a song that you supposedly heard on the radio, and make fun of her for not knowing it.
Use the word "idiot."
Never make her pancakes. Force her to make you pancakes, in the middle of the night.

Gene: Yeah. I can pee on myself. I don't need any handouts!
Tina: Listen, this town gave us the best candy we've ever seen. We owe it to them to go back.
Gene: Great. Now my candy tastes like guilt.
Louise: Augh, FINE! We'll go back and save Milo and what's-his-face, but I get to slap Gene!
