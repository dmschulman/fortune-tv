Dr. Jennifer Melfi: What line of work are you in?
Tony Soprano: Waste management consultant.
%
Livia Soprano: Well, all I know is, daughters are better at taking care of 
their mothers than sons.
Tony Soprano: Yeah, and I bought CDs for a broken record.
%
Dr. Jennifer Melfi: With today's pharmacology, no one needs to suffer with

Big Pussy Bonpensiero: Luca Brasi. Luca...
Christopher Moltisanti: Whatever.

Uncle Junior: (to Tony) You may run North Jersey but you don't run your Uncle 
Junior. How many fucking hours did I spend playing catch with you?
%
Brendan Filone: So my boy at Comley...said there's a truckload of Italian suits.
Christopher Moltisanti: Those unload fast. Mario'll take the whole load.
Brendan Filone: He said shipment moves Thursday, six a.m.
Christopher Moltisanti: Give me one good reason I should not jack this truck!
Brendan Filone: Hey, don't feel bad, its Junior's own fault. He gives us no 
choice except to do it again.
Christopher Moltisanti: Takin' that outrageous fuckin' tribute?
Brendan Filone: It's like not only does he shit on our heads, we're supposed to 
say thanks for the hat.
Christopher Moltisanti: It's not like I'm gettin' somewhere's playin' by the 
rules! Fuck Tony!
Brendan Filone: The books are closed...blow me.
Christopher Moltisanti: No, that's some true shit.
Brendan Filone: Come on, they're not confirmin' any new made guys, how come?
Christopher Moltisanti: Fuckin' chaos! Nobody knows whose runnin' things 
anymore. Guys, they don't even know who to make payments up the ladder to in 
some cases. I'm talkin' about the year two thousand. The millenium. Where do we 
go from here?
%
Brendan Filone: Yo, money, we said we'd meet out front. You're not even dressed.
Christopher Moltisanti: I'm taking a pass.
Brendan Filone: What? It's Italian suits, Christopher!
Christopher Moltisanti: There was a time in my life when being with the Tony 
Soprano crew was all I ever dreamed of. So what am I doing?
Brendan Filone: Come on, it's five fifteen.
Christopher Moltisanti: Maybe one reason things are so fucked up in the 
organization these days is guys running off, not listening to middle management.
Brendan Filone: Fuck Tony. That's a quote.
Christopher Moltisanti: We have to stick together, why be in a crew? Why be a 
gangster?
Brendan Filone: Hey coach? Suck my dick.
%
Special K: (A Comley truck approaches) Yo! Hey, yo! We need some help over here!
Brendan Filone: (Brendan Filone, Antjuan, and Special K hijack the truck) Okay, 
lets be very cool yo! Get down outta the cab!
Special K: You heard the motherfucker! Hurry up!
Hector Anthony: (Stepping out) Yo chill. I'm a friend of Billy's. Your friend 
on the inside.
Brendan Filone: Ya, cool. No probs here! Increase the peace, that's our motto.
Hector Anthony: I'm gonna take my lunch, okay?
Brendan Filone: Yeah, whatever. Come on! (Hector steps down and Antjuan tries 
to climb the truck)
Special K: Hold up man! You can't drive a Fisher Price. (Special K climbs the 
truck)
Brendan Filone: (Antjuan is holding his gun sideways) What is with the 
gun-point-sideways-shit! (Brendan fixes Antjuan's arm)
Antjuan: (Special K isn't able to drive the truck) Ha ha ha ha!
Brendan Filone: (to Special K) Get out! Come on, get down! (to Hector Anthony) 
You drive, I'll direct you! (Special K steps out and accidentally drops his 
gun, releasing a ricochet bullet that hits Hector Anthony)
Brendan Filone: Oh! Jesus!
Antjuan: Control yer shit fool! (Once they see Hector is dead, Special K and 
Antjuan run away)
Brendan Filone: Fuck. Oh fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck, Junior fuckin' Soprano's gonna 
go ape shit! Fuck!

Tony Soprano: You boys...you boys...I'll tell ya...it's beautiful stuff though. 
(about Italian suits they were left with after Brendan hijacked a Comley truck)
Brendan Filone: Ton', I'm so sorry-
Tony Soprano: Shut up!
Christopher Moltisanti: Just so long as you realize I had nothin' ta do with 
this Ton'.
Brendan Filone: Ton', that's true, he stood home-
Tony Soprano: Shut up! You stood home? Did you do anything ta stop it? Did you 
offer any guidance? What do we mean when we say leadership, hm?
Brendan Filone: Ton', part of it's the crank, you know, but I'm goin' into the 
detox, swear to my mother.
Christopher Moltisanti: Brendan, shut the fuck up. You wanna get me clipped?
%
Tony Soprano: You know, you got a reputation for immaturity, and its not gonna 
be improved by not paying the tributes the acting boss demands of you.
Brendan Filone: Acting boss my ass Ton'. Come on, everybody knows you really 
run things since Jackie became the Chemosabe.
%
Brendan Filone: Un-fuckin'-believable. We just returned maybe the biggest score 
of my whole year.
Christopher Moltisanti: Listen you fuck! Uncle Junior's been breakin' Tony's 
balls 'cuz you hijacked that truck. You're lucky Tony doesn't shove the cab up 
your ass.
%
Mikey Palmice: I think you should've taken care of this Christopher Moltisanti 
thing the minute it first happened. You should've sent a clear-cut signal... 
You fuck with Junior Soprano-
Uncle Junior: Take it easy. We're not making a western here.
%
Hunter Scangarelo: We wanna score some crystal.
Brendan Filone: Yeah, you got money?
Christopher Moltisanti: Shut up, you ain't givin' them shit.
Meadow Soprano: Why not?
Christopher Moltisanti: How 'bout for starters your father will put a bullet in 
my head.
%
Brendan Filone: So why don't you call Tony, so he can call Junior, and see if 
we can change the fucking channel.
%
Brendan Filone: Kids, you think you can protect 'em, well you can't.
%
Christopher Moltisanti: This ain't negotiation time. This is Scarface, final 
scene, fuckin' bazookas under each arm, 'say hello to my little friend!'
Silvio Dante: Always with the scenarios.
%
Tony Soprano: What the hell are you doin'? (after seeing Vin pissing near Green 
Grove retirement community)
Vin Makazian: This place is an hour from my office.
Tony Soprano: An hour? What are you a woman, get a bladder transplant, my 
mother lives here.
Vin Makazian: Yeah, well, that's not real convenient for me.
Tony Soprano: That's not convenient, I'm sorry, why don't we meet down by your 
precinct, you know the government would love a few pictures of us together for 
the scrapbook. (sarcastic)

Uncle Junior: Hear about the Chinese godfather? He made them an offer they 
couldn't understand.

Yo Yo Mendez: Chris ma man.
Christopher Moltisanti: Surprised to see me?
Yo Yo Mendez: Heard they took you for a little ride to the meadowlands.
Christopher Moltisanti: Oh yeah?
Yo Yo Mendez: Heard you had a little "bm" out there.
Christopher Moltisanti: Okay, so you got my cut.
Yo Yo Mendez: They came and took it.
Christopher Moltisanti: Who?
Yo Yo Mendez: Junior Soprano's boys. They said you was out and its they corner 
now.
Christopher Moltisanti: You let them do that?
Yo Yo Mendez: I don't argue too well suckin' on a smith and wesson.
Christopher Moltisanti: You didn't beep me?
Yo Yo Mendez: Word on the street, you're out o' commision. Sorry man, business. 
Chris, you know there's no one I'd rather give my ten points to than you!
Christopher Moltisanti: It's alright. It's not your fault.
Yo Yo Mendez: He..I'm glad to hear you you say that man. (Chris slam kicks 
Mendez right in the nuts and proceeds to kick his ass) Ayy!!! Sneaky mother 
fucker!!! Ah! Shit!! Oh!!
Christopher Moltisanti: I don't care if they shove a scud missile up your ass. 
This is my corner. You pay any one but me, I'm comin' back for your thumbs. And 
that didn't happen what you said.
Yo Yo Mendez: Kill you...(lying on the floor messed up)
%
Christopher Moltisanti: Clipping a famous rat would put me a cunt hair away 
from being made.
%
Tony Soprano: I'm in the waste management business. Everybody immediately 
assumes you're mobbed up. It's a stereotype, and it's offensive.
%
Meadow Soprano: A couple of weeks ago, me and some friends, we were doing 
speed. We did kind of a lot of it for a while.
Tony Soprano: You what?!
Meadow Soprano: It was just between homework and SAT's and just the general 
pressure of life, we needed something to keep going.
Tony Soprano: That crap will kill you.
Meadow Soprano: I know.
Tony Soprano: I oughta slap the shit outta you. Where did you get it?
Meadow Soprano: If I thought this was gonna be a lecture, I never woulda told 
you.
Tony Soprano: Take a reality check, what do you think I'm gonna say? Where did 
you get it?
Meadow Soprano: No way I'm telling you, especially after this reaction.
Tony Soprano: Why did you tell me?
Meadow Soprano: You were honest to me today. I won't be doing it again, it got 
too scary.
Tony Soprano: Jesus, right under my nose. Think you'd know.
Meadow Soprano: No dad, you won't.
Tony Soprano: I'm glad you told me, despite of everything.
Meadow Soprano: I'm glad I did too, I'm glad we have that kind of relationship.
%
Tony Soprano: My father was in it. My uncle was in it. Maybe I was too lazy ta 
think for myself.
%
Christopher Moltisanti: Yo.
Tony Soprano: What do ya got?
Christopher Moltisanti: Wet shoes.
Tony Soprano: Hey, you chose this life. You don't wanna work in the rain, try 
for the fuckin' Yankees.

Mikey Palmice: (to Rusty Irish) Listen to me. I'm gonna give you a break. I'm 
gonna give you a break. When I toss you over... If you can fly, I won't shoot 
you down.

Dr. Jennifer Melfi: When's the last time you had a prostate exam?
Tony Soprano: Hey, I don't even let anybody wag their finger in my face.
Dr. Jennifer Melfi: (Melfi cracks up laughing) I'm sorry, I shouldn't have 
laughed.
Tony Soprano: Don't apologize.
Dr. Jennifer Melfi: Oh boy...
Tony Soprano: You got a nice laugh.
%
Tony Soprano: Alright, lemme hear it.
Jimmy Altieri: Rusty Irish.
Tony Soprano: What about him?
Larry Boy Barese: He took a header off the falls.
Raymond Curto: That's the closest that junkie fuck ever got to a bath.
Larry Boy Barese: Yeah, well I got news for you. That junkie fuck was my 
biggest earner. During the football season, he moved more cards than 10 guys 
put together. And another thing, a certain friend of ours should've checked 
with me before he did a favor for the old man Capri.
%
Dr. Jennifer Melfi: What's the one thing, every woman, your mother, your wife, 
your daughter, have in common?
Tony Soprano: They all break my balls.
%
Tony Soprano: All due respect to New York, I don't think you should be tellin' 
my uncle how ta run things.
Johnny Sack: You think I got the balls ta drive in from New York and tell your 
uncle how he should run his family? I shouldn't expect to see the Statue of 
Liberty again if I did that, huh?
%
Tony Soprano: I was proud to be Johnny Soprano's kid. When he beat the shit out 
of that guy, I went to the class, I told them how tough my father was.
%
Livia Soprano: He goes to talk about his mother. That's what he's doing. He 
talks about me, he complains. 'She didn't do this, she did that.' Oh, I gave my 
life to my children on a silver platter, and this is how he repays me.
%
Uncle Junior: I bet that gym teacher shit a brick when your little friend puked 
on his boots, huh Anthony? (Anthony Junior laughs)
Tony Soprano: Wanna encourage him Uncle Jun'?
Uncle Junior: Hey, whatever happened ta boys will be boys?
Carmela Soprano: He stole from the church.
%
Old Woman: How come he's not in school?
Livia Soprano: Because he was a bad boy.
%
Tony Soprano: (to Dr. Jennifer Melfi) Don't start talkin' ta me about 
legitimate business. What about chemical companies? Dumpin' all that shit into 
the rivers and they get all these deformed babies poppin' all over the place.
%
Jeffrey Wernick: (Christopher watches Jeffrey Wernick on television) They will 
undoubtedly be focused on the, as yet unsolved, execution style slaying of 
Soprano family associate Brendan Filone. Was it part of a power struggle? My 
sources tell me that Filone...
Christopher Moltisanti: No one would ever had ranked him as associate.
Jeffrey Wernick: ...is a loyal soldier, if you will, and he winds up dead...for 
no as yet apparent reason.
Christopher Moltisanti: Soldier?! Brendan Filone...associate, soldier?! Fuck 
you! (Christopher throws his remote at the television)

Bakery Clerk: You motherfucker! You shot my foot!
Christopher Moltisanti: It happens.

Georgie: Fucking amazing though, huh? You know what, that news guy, he said the 
words Brendan Filone, I'm telling you, the hairs on the back of my neck stood 
up. I mean, I knew the guy.

identity, he's dead.

chrissake. How about that huh? My nephew is seeing a psychiatrist. It makes me 
wanna cry.
Mikey Palmice: No shit...
Uncle Junior: Indictment's being prepared. He's spilling his guts.
Mikey Palmice: I fucking knew it.
Uncle Junior: No, you didn't fucking know it, I just told you.

Anthony Junior: 'Cuz you'll make the dead people jealous.

Larry Boy Barese: Hey mama Livia, how are you? Do you remember me, Larry Boy 
Barese.
Livia Soprano: I know who you are. You lit an apartment house on fire and 
scared your mother half to death.
Larry Boy Barese: Momma's movin' in here on the 15th.
Livia Soprano: Oo, I like your shoes Larry Boy.
Larry Boy Barese: Eh, Momma hasn't been well in the mind. Last week she threw a 
jar of artichokes at me.
Livia Soprano: Well, she better not throw any artichokes at me.

Coach Don Hauser: You tell your friends I know all about them.

converted rice!

Tony Soprano: I'm not gonna hurt a man that I love because of some cop gossip 
from a degenerate fuckin' gambler with a badge. You understand me?
Vin Makazian: You know... You got an amazing ability to sum up a man's whole 
life in a single sentence. "Degenerate gambler with a badge." You're a pisser, 
you're a real pisser.

Carmela Soprano: Is that why they tried to kill you? Because you're seeing a 
psychiatrist?
Tony Soprano: What're you talkin' about? It was a carjackin'.
Carmela Soprano: At least have the decency not to lie to me.
Tony Soprano: What do ya wanna do Carmela? You wanna move to Utah? Be Mr. and 
Mrs. Mike Smith? We...we can sell some Indian relics by the road. Maybe start a 
rattlesnake ranch.
Carmela Soprano: This is our chance ta get out Tony. We could start a whole new 
life.
Tony Soprano: Have some Mormons over the dinner. Eat some tomatoes that have no

Artie Bucco: Don't make it worse. Do me the respect of not treating me like a 
fuckin' idiot piece of shit. When you blew up the restaurant, you made me party 
to a criminal conspiracy, did you ever stop ta think about that?
Tony Soprano: I don't know what she told you, my mother, of all people...two 
arson investigators gave that fire a clean bill o' health Artie. Why the fuck 
would I blow up your restaurant?
Artie Bucco: To help me! You fuckin' bent psycho! You hear your uncle's gonna 
hurt my business by stagin' a hit in my place and that's yer solution?! To burn

FBI Interrogator: You prefer Corrado or Junior?
Uncle Junior: I prefer Mr. Soprano.
FBI Interrogator: Your tenure as boss was a short one. Actually, it was unusual 
in several ways. Let me put this to you as simply as I can. You can avoid 
sentencing on these charges if you will testify that in fact, you were not the 
boss of North Jersey, that in fact, your nephew Anthony Soprano was and is. 
That he de facto controlled your capos with the backing of two of the New York 
families communicating through their emissary, John Sacrimoni. We want Johnny 
Sack. But more than him, we want Mangano and Teresi.
Uncle Junior: I want to fuck Angie Dickinson, let's see who gets lucky first.

technologies' two years behind, your stock's a dog.
Matthew Bevilaqua: (Sean and Matt beat the crap out of the worker) You fuckin' 
think a minute!
Manager: Hey, stop that! Hey, I'm still the manager here, this is unacceptable. 
Where's Moltisanti? I'm gonna make a call if you don't think I know who really 
runs this operation.
Matthew Bevilaqua: Get back in your fuckin' office! (looks around the room) 
Anybody else got a problem with Webistics???

Psychiatrist: I watch the news like everyone else. I know who you are, and I

Big Pussy Bonpensiero: Yeah, well, remind me Tony, never to get sick again, 
huh? Remind me, please, never to have a serious illness, because, with you, and 
Silvio, and Paulie, and all you pricks, weakness could spread as fuckin' 
treason!
Tony Soprano: You know what? Fuck you! I don't wanna hear about your fuckin' 
back anymore! Who's your fucking boss, huh? Who's your fucking boss? Who gets 
the explanation? What am I, supposed to trust you? You fuckin' off the

Tony Soprano: Who?
Jack Massarone: Ah this hard on, Reverend Herman James, Jr. He's an old song, 
not enough minorities doing the joint-fitting.
Tony Soprano: You were told the joint fitters union is under my uncle's 
jurisdiction.
Jack Massarone: I know. But if you could pave the way for me to talk to your 
uncle, so he could maybe send some guys down and you know, make it 
uncomfortable for these people. Like you did with your unions before.
Tony Soprano: It's gonna cost you.
Jack Massarone: Besides what you're already raping me for those no-show 
electrician jobs?
Tony Soprano: You're not such a fucking citizen when you want a construction 
bid to go your way, are ya Jack?
Jack Massarone: Ok...ok. Take it easy.

year for bed wetting?
Anthony Junior: It was the year before last.
Carmela Soprano: You could have killed those girls.
Anthony Junior: That would have been interesting.
Carmela Soprano: What? What did you say?
Anthony Junior: Death just shows you the ultimate absurdity of life.
Tony Soprano: What is this?? Are you trying to get me to lose my temper because 
I'm about to put you through that goddamn window!!
Anthony Junior: See? That's what I mean. Life is absurd.
Carmela Soprano: Don't say that! God forgive you!
Anthony Junior: There is no God.

Carmela Soprano: Where is this coming from?
Tony Soprano: Do they teach you this crap in school??
Carmela Soprano: Is this that new English teacher Mr. Clark...emm... Where is 
he from? Answer me!

Meadow Soprano: You want him to read anything other than Hustler? Hello. He got 
assigned &#733;The Stranger&#733; You want him to be an educated person? What 
do you think education is? You just make more money? This IS education.
Anthony Junior: Do you ever think like: Why were we born?
Meadow Soprano: Madame de Stael said: In life one must choose between boredom 
and suffering.
Tony Soprano: Go to your room! (Meadow leaves)
Anthony Junior: No, I'm serious. Why were we born?
Carmela Soprano: We were born because of Adam and Eve, that's why. Now go 
upstairs and do your math.
Anthony Junior: Algebra?? That's the most boring.
Tony Soprano: Well, your other choice is sufferin'. You wanna start now?!?

Matthew Bevilaqua: To kick upstairs to Tony Soprano would be an honor.

Matthew Bevilaqua: Camel nose!
Sean Gismonte: Man, you can't make that shit up.
Richie Aprile: The fuck are you talkin' about? I just did. Did you ever notice 
he's the only motherfucker who can smoke a cigarette in the rain with his hands 
tied behind his back? That nose is like natural canopy. (Sean and Matt laugh) 
You know the kid has his good points.
Matthew Bevilaqua: Yeah, yeah, I know. I'm not sayin' anything against him. 
He's my homie.
Richie Aprile: Your what?!?
Matthew Bevilaqua: He lives up near me.
Richie Aprile: Well, why didn't you say that? If you wanna talk like a fuckin' 
mulignan, we'll send you to slip-and-fall school.

Matthew Bevilaqua: This is fucked.

Matthew Bevilaqua: Sean, for chrissakes, grow up to reality. We are nowhere. 
Buyin' fish, punchin' safes, what is that, and for what?
Sean Gismonte: We're just gettin' started. It's what you do.

Christopher Moltisanti: I crossed over to the other side.
Tony Soprano: You what?
Christopher Moltisanti: I saw the tunnel and the white light...and I saw my 
father in hell.
Paulie Walnuts: Get the fuck out of here.
Christopher Moltisanti: And the bouncer said that I'd be there too when my time 
comes.
Paulie Walnuts: What bouncer?
Christopher Moltisanti: "The emerald piper", that's our hell. It's an Irish bar 
where it's St. Patrick's day everyday forever. Mikey Palmice and Brendan Filone 
were there too. They were friends.
Paulie Walnuts: Those two guys hated each other.
Tony Soprano: You gotta relax, you just need some rest.
Christopher Moltisanti: They're friends now. They were playing dice with two 
Roman soldiers and a bunch of the Irish guys.
Paulie Walnuts: Doesn't make sense.
Christopher Moltisanti: The Irish, they were winning every roll.
%
Paulie Walnuts: You didn't go to hell. You went to purgatory, my friend.
Christopher Moltisanti: I forgot all about purgatory.
Paulie Walnuts: Purgatory, a little detour on the way to paradise.
Christopher Moltisanti: How long you think we gotta stay there?
Paulie Walnuts: That's different for everybody. You add up all your mortal 
sins, multiply that number by 50, then you add up all your venial sins and 
multiply that by 25. You add them together, and that's your sentence. I figure 
i'm gonna have to do about 6,000 years before I get accepted into heaven. And 
6,000 years is nothing in eternity terms. I could do that standing on my head. 
It's like a couple of days here.
%
Paulie Walnuts: There's no denying it. I'm dragging a bunch of fucking ghouls 
around with me and Mikey's their fucking ringleader.

Tony Soprano: Why don't you just take it easy, will ya? We just wanna talk to 
ya. That's all.

Matthew Bevilaqua: You're gonna fuckin' kill me for somethin' I didn't do.
Tony Soprano: Don't you think we coulda killed you already, if we wanted you 
dead. Relax. We just wanna talk to you.
Matthew Bevilaqua: Tony, it was...it was Sean! You got to believe me, it was 
Sean, he got nuts! He said we're being pissed on and disrespected and that we 
should score points with Richie. But I told him hey, Rome wasn't built in one 
day! Anything Tony, I'll tell you anything you wanna know.
Tony Soprano: What'd Richie say?
Matthew Bevilaqua: It had nothin' to do with Richie, he didn't ask for it. He 
got mad when I told 'im. Sean did it on spec.
Tony Soprano: Alright. Come here. Come here. Come on. Are you sure nobody else 
was involved. Take a minute, think it over.
Matthew Bevilaqua: It was Sean all the way.
Tony Soprano: Alright. You're a good kid.
Matthew Bevilaqua: I'm thirsty.
Tony Soprano: See if we got somethin' to drink.
Big Pussy Bonpensiero: What can I get ya? You want a Fanta? Somethin' like that?
Tony Soprano: How is that? I mean, you sure you want a diet drink? You don't 
want somethin' with some sugar in it?
Big Pussy Bonpensiero: There was only diet.
Matthew Bevilaqua: It's good.
Tony Soprano: You finished?
Matthew Bevilaqua: Thank you T.

Pussy shoot Matt)

is like a license to steal. What's he throwing your way? U gatz. This garbage 
thing, he's already taking your townships. Now he's fucking with mine?
Uncle Junior: What am I supposed to do about it? I'm under indictment.
Richie Aprile: Sorry, Junior, I don't want to rip open old wounds, but...
Uncle Junior: I'm in no shape for disharmony.
Richie Aprile: You and I both know he's gotta go.
Uncle Junior: That's my nephew you're talkin' about. How dare you in my own 
home!
Richie Aprile: C'mon junior, this fucking guy was supposed to be laid out on 
midland avenue a year ago. I know it. You know it.
Uncle Junior: Let me tell you who's not a good kid. That niece of mine. I left 
my brother's house one night and my wallet was light. I'm talkin' about a 
10-year-girl here, Richie. A word to the wise, that's all i'm saying.

say Janice?
Janice Soprano: What?!
Richie Aprile: Don't what me! Why'd you say that?
Janice Soprano: I was making love to you baby!
Richie Aprile: You know what you said.
Janice Soprano: I was in the heat of passion, I'm doin' it like you like.
Richie Aprile: "Boss" this. "Boss" that. It Should be you! That's not part of 
it. How can you think of shit like that during sex? You're not in the moment.
Janice Soprano: I find powerful men erotic.
Richie Aprile: Is that another dig in me?
Janice Soprano: Oh, Jesus, Richie.
Richie Aprile: I got to be loyal. Without that, we crumble.
Janice Soprano: Tell that to Paul Castellano.
Richie Aprile: I'm old school, Janice.
Janice Soprano: All I mean is my brother needs help.
Richie Aprile: Teaching him manners is one thing.
Janice Soprano: My Uncle Junior still has friends and Junior thinks the world 
of you. When your opponent gives you an opening, be swift as a hare.
Richie Aprile: When I think of that jacket I gave your brother and he spit on 
it. I could slice an ear off his head.
Janice Soprano: Richie wait, wha-- ma, (Livia comes down the stairs) if you 
need something, call, I'll bring it up.
Livia Soprano: Are you smoking marijuana? I want to watch the tv.
Janice Soprano: Well, we should get another one for your room.

around.

FBI Agent 2: And the other man?
Witness: Unfortunately, I didn't get a good look at him. The light was 
reflecting off the windshield. But he was heavy set. It was really dark. I 
didn't want them to see me. I heard gunshots but I, I thought it was kids with 
firecrackers, and then when two men drove out in a car, I crouched down in the 
ragweed.
FBI Agent 2: Sure.
Witness: It began to dawn on me, what had happened. Like I told the responding 
officers, I didn't finish changing the tire, I walked to a phone and called 
right away.
FBI Agent 1: Thank you Mr. Arthur.
Witness: So goddamn fed up with crime, I..I'd hate myself if I didn't come 
forward, help you put these people behind bars.
FBI Agent 2: Thanks to people like you, we may just do that.
Witness: May I ask who the dead man was?

Bevilaqua, a Soprano family associate.

member.

slams Janice in the face)

around the gills. Flu, i'm guessing. But maybe he ate something didn't agree 
with him.
Big Pussy Bonpensiero: Food poisoning?
Artie Bucco: No, what, salmonella? No! But he had a reaction. You guys ate at 
an Indian restaurant. It would help if we knew, did you have any symptoms?
Big Pussy Bonpensiero: No. Well, once during the night, I did have a slight 
touch of diarrhea. That's all, it passed.
Artie Bucco: Nothing. Touch of diarrhea.

Paulie Walnuts: Amazing thing about snakes is that they reproduce spontaneously.
Tony Soprano: What do you mean?
Paulie Walnuts: They have both male and female sex organs. That’s why 
somebody you don’t trust you call a snake. How can you trust a guy who can 
literally go fuck themselves?
Tony Soprano: Don’t you think that expression would’ve come from the Adam 
and Eve story? When the snake tempted Eve to bite the apple?
Paulie Walnuts: Hey, snakes were fucking themselves long before Adam and Eve 
showed up, T.

It's despicable. That's one ride I would've loved ta been along on.

Bobby Baccilieri: Nah...I can't do that.
Silvio Dante: Why not?
Bobby Baccilieri: I don't know. I don't know how.
Paulie Walnuts: Eh, what's to know. You ask 'em what they want for Christmas, 
you give 'em a nice toy, and that's the end of it.
Bobby Baccilieri: Nah...not me...I can't.
Paulie Walnuts: Yes you can.
Bobby Baccilieri: I can't.
Paulie Walnuts: Why not?
Bobby Baccilieri: I'm shy.

pajamas. It's the fuckin' Yukon out there.
Christopher Moltisanti: Probably thinks we left anyway.
Paulie Walnuts: If he's alive, which he ain't. What's that?
Christopher Moltisanti: Nathan's bag. Fuck, there's some ketchups and shit.
Paulie Walnuts: They clean?

Paulie Walnuts: Who gives a shit. Keep diggin'. Not that it matters now. We 
didn't come ta your house ta kill ya! That mouth o' yours. You gotta learn to 
shut the fuck up.
Christopher Moltisanti: So how far is it to Atlantic City? (Valery swings the 
shovel right into Chris's head and slams him hard. Then he hits Paulie with the 
other end of the shovel right in his stomach and runs off.)

Tony Soprano: You tell me. Is it worth it?
Paulie Walnuts: I hit 'im in the head Ton. I saw it with my own eyes.
Tony Soprano: Is it possible this fuck made it outta here alive?
Bobby Baccilieri: It's hard to say. Flesh wound maybe. Head shot, I dunno. On 
the other hand, anything's possible.
Tony Soprano: You're a captain. What do you wanna do? (To Paulie)
Paulie Walnuts: Fuck it. Lets go home.
Tony Soprano: Alright. But lets be clear on this right now. This cocksucka 
crawls out from under a rock, he's your problem, not mine. You deal with Slava,

Stay the fuck away from Tony Soprano, shut the fuck up and listen. It's over. 
Capice? Over and done. You call, or go anywhere near him or his family and 
they'll be scraping your nipples off these fine leather seats. And here's the 
point to remember: my face is the last one you'll see, not Tony's...we 
understand each other? It won't be cinematic.

hardly ever goes to war anymore.
Carmela Soprano: They were marching with rifles, Tony.
Tony Soprano: The barrels are plugged! They're symbolic!
Carmela Soprano: Symbolic of what?
Tony Soprano: Respect!
Carmela Soprano: He will be subjected to the discipline of kids hardly older 
than himself. Does that seem smart? Boys his age still kill frogs and small 
animals.
Tony Soprano: The Cusamano's Binky? The cherry bomb with the nails in it, you 
think it was AJ?
Carmela Soprano: No, that is what I'm trying to tell you. He is still a child. 
He's a normal child. He's made some mistakes. God knows, he's got a shitload to 
learn about life. That does not mean that I'm gonna let you send him to the 
type of school whose whole reason for being is to make him follow orders by 
instilling fear.
Tony Soprano: He thinks the world owes him a fuckin' livin'.
Carmela Soprano: What could've given him that bizarre idea?
Tony Soprano: We tried it your way for fifteen years now, with Berry Brazel to 
validatin' his feelings and that fuckin' school did the same thing and what a 
surprise. He thinks the world runs on his feelings! Well, he's gonna go learn 
to be a man.
Carmela Soprano: I will not send him to that place.

Bobby Baccilieri: World really went downhill after the World Trade Center. You 
know, Quasimodo predicted all of this.
Tony Soprano: Who did what?
Bobby Baccilieri: All these problems, the middle east. The end o' the world.
Tony Soprano: Nostradamus. Quasimodo's the hunchback of Notre Dame.
Bobby Baccilieri: Oh, right. Notredamus.
Tony Soprano: Nostradamus and Notre Dame, that's two different things 
completely.
Bobby Baccilieri: It's interesting though they'd be so similar, isn't it? And I 
always thought, "OK, Hunchback of Notre Dame. You also got your quarterback and 
your halfback of Notre Dame".
Tony Soprano: One's a fucking cathedral!
Bobby Baccilieri: Obviously, I know. I'm just sayin'. It's interesting, the 
coincidence. What, you're gonna tell me you never pondered that? The back thing 
with Notre Dame?

your information, Ralph is a great guy.

Johnny Sack: I have to repeat it? My word's not good enough?
Carmine Lupertazzi: Not if you want him clipped over it.
Johnny Sack: He said she was havin' a 90 pound mole removed from her ass. The 
implication was that her ass is so big, she can have a mole that size removed 
from it.

Ralph Cifaretto: Fuck yes, I'm denyin' I said it.
Johnny Sack: I don't believe you.
Ralph Cifaretto: Just...just tell me who said this. I'll put a bullet in their 
fuckin' eye.
Johnny Sack: You're a real weasel you know that?
Ralph Cifaretto: John, please. Look. Last year, when Tony and I had our, our 
thing, that misunderstanding, you were the voice of reason. You were the one 
that told me to apologize.
Johnny Sack: Oh, so you're apologizing?
Ralph Cifaretto: If that's what it takes.
Johnny Sack: Why would you apologize? I thought you didn't say it.
Ralph Cifaretto: I didn't say it.
Johnny Sack: You know somethin' Ralph, not only are you a thief, you're a lying 
fucking prick. I should've let Tony chop your head off a year ago.

Johnny Sack: He's got a bad history Tony. Cute cocksucker could wind up dead.
Tony Soprano: What are you sayin' here?
Johnny Sack: He's a two faced fucking prick.
Tony Soprano: I thought Ralph was your friend.
Johnny Sack: Right. That's rich. Did you hear what my friend said about my 
wife? Made a crack about Ginny's weight. Something about her havin' a ninety 
pound mole on her ass.
Tony Soprano: Well that's uh...that's deplorable. Who told you this?
Johnny Sack: What's important was that it was said.
Tony Soprano: Well if he did say it, I didn't hear it. Cause he knows better 
than to make a remark like that when I'm around.

Adriana La Cerva: Let's be honest. What's our future here, Christopher? 
You...you could end up in jail or something horrible could happen.
Christopher Moltisanti: Fuckin' negative shit. Stop with that.

Christopher Moltisanti: Who?!
Adriana La Cerva: I don't know.
Christopher Moltisanti: What the fuck kind of shit is this? Who told you that?
Adriana La Cerva: Nobody.
Christopher Moltisanti: Fuckin' negative shit coming out of your mouth! I had 
that fuckin' bird watching me when I got made. I'm already under a

car for a family.
Teddy Genaretti: Do I know you?
Bobby Baccilieri: Jim Blake.
Teddy Genaretti: What local you in?
Bobby Baccilieri: Bad back. It's just that I follow these things, you know, 
this election coming up. Dick Hoffman for president? I heard he's got one 
eighty four's vote. I think it's a mistake.
Teddy Genaretti: Pension's been ripped off for the last twenty five years.
Bobby Baccilieri: Hey, I'm sure you guys got grievances, but Dick Hoffman? What 
do you owe this guy? It's all talk. He's out of touch with reality, Dick. You 
think if push came to shove he'd give a fuck about you?
Teddy Genaretti: I know what you're trying to do.
Bobby Baccilieri: You look like a smart guy. I can see why your local puts 
their faith in you to do the right thing. I'm just saying, if it was me? I got 
kids that depend on me, like yourself. And to waste my votes on somebody like 
Dick Hoffman? I might as well put a bullet in my head, here, here and here.

Agent Dwight Harris: Here's what's problematic. You don't even know where your 
boyfriend is half the time, so how do you know if he's in trouble or not? He's 
into heroin, organized crime, he's associating with some very dangerous 
people...not to mention Tony Soprano himself.
Adriana La Cerva: See, that's where you're wrong. Tony would never let anything 
happen to Christopher. They're cousins, he loves him.
Agent Robyn Sanseverino: He loved Pussy Bonpensiero. What happened to him?
Adriana La Cerva: He went in the Witness Protection program.
Agent Robyn Sanseverino: Dwight? He went into the program? You know anything

you, I envy you. It's like an instinct, like a hawk sees a little mouse movin' 
around a corn field from a mile up.
Tony Soprano: You think it's my fault you're fuckin' lyin' in here?
Artie Bucco: It's just that somebody mentions fifty grand, to bankroll a French 
digestif, and your mind goes through all the permutations at like, internet 
speed and realizes, "Oh, worst case scenario, I eat for free."
Tony Soprano: You fuckin' suicide. You're disgraceful!
Artie Bucco: I'm sorry.
Tony Soprano: Nah, fuck that!!! Does anybody else know it was me that loaned 
you the money?
Artie Bucco: Like who?
Tony Soprano: Like who? I don't give a fuck who. Adriana, Father Intintola, my 
wife...anybody? (Artie nods no) Alright...ya...ya...ya got mugged. Outside o' 
yer house. It was a street crime. Kids, they took yer wallet and yer watch. 
Where are they?
Artie Bucco: Why?
Tony Soprano: Come on! (Tony takes Artie's belongings) Why? You don't care what 
people think. Well, I do. Enough people hate me! You fought back. They ripped 
yer earrin' outta yer ear, you were bleedin', you went inside yer house, 
you...you took a bunch o' pills to kill the pain 'cuz you knew you'd have to 
wait at the emergency room for a couple o' hours.

Artie Bucco: Nice crib. You were supposed to give me my money two days ago.
Jean-Philippe Colbert: I know. Credit Lyonnais, they didn't come through with 
the second round of financing yet. My partners are sick about it.
Artie Bucco: Well, that's not my problem Jean-Philippe, I want my money.
Jean-Philippe Colbert: I just told you. I don't have it.
Artie Bucco: Well, when are you gonna get it?
Jean-Philippe Colbert: I don't know okay. I don't know. Doesn't look too good.
Artie Bucco: Whoah...whoah...whoah...whoah...what does that...what does that 
mean?!
Jean-Philippe Colbert: I mean, I don't know if its going to happen alright. 
They...they were not convinced we are a business model. They didn't agree there 
was as much potential for Armagnac. The problem has been it seems that people 
cannot figure out how to market Armagnac. The hip approach like with Stoli, 
fails.
Artie Bucco: You said it was the next vodka!!!
Jean-Philippe Colbert: Hey, so we are big boys, we must move on.
Artie Bucco: Frog eatin' fuckin' faggia di cazz'.
Jean-Philippe Colbert: What did you say?
Artie Bucco: I said I want my money!!

me?
Christopher Moltisanti: 'Course I'd still love ya...why?
Adriana La Cerva: There's something you should know. A long time ago, years 
ago, I had a medical procedure. It was before we met. My uterus got pierced.
Christopher Moltisanti: Both of 'em?
Adriana La Cerva: There's only one. That's ovaries.
Christopher Moltisanti: So, what does that mean, you can't get pregnant?
Adriana La Cerva: Well, my doctor said it might be hard. A friend of mine gave 
me the name of a specialist in Manhattan.
Christopher Moltisanti: You knew you were damaged goods and you never fuckin' 
told me!?
Adriana La Cerva: How could you call me that?
Christopher Moltisanti: Jesus fuckin' Christ, how could ya lie to me like that!

Moltisanti name ends, that's it!

emergency surgery performed upon arrival at headquarters, after discovery of a 
small rodent in the rectal passage.
Nucci Gaultieri: OH, MY GOD!
Ralph Cifaretto: A gerbil, ma'am. Uh, the county does not cover medical 
procedures deemed caused by criminal sexual activity. Section four, paragraph 
fifteen. We'll need an insurance number.

then he can put 'em back in, too.

Prosecutor: Ladies and gentlemen, Corrado Soprano is not some harmless old man 
being persecuted by the government but a ruthless and calculating mob boss who 
controls a vast criminal enterprise. Over the past few months, you've heard 
from FBI agents who have documented clandestine meetings at his doctor's 
offices. Tales of bid rigging, sweetheart deals, secret payoffs, and even 
murder. No, Corrado Soprano is not some harmless old man, but a killer who 
orders up murder like you and I order up coffee.

Carmela Soprano: The last year, I have been dreaming and fantasizing and in 
love with Furio.
Tony Soprano: (laughing) he..ha...what?
Carmela Soprano: Every morning when he'd come to pick you up, I would look 
forward to it all night long in bed, next to you. Those nights when you were 
actually in the bed. And he would ring the doorbell, I felt like my heart would 
come out of my chest. He would smile, and we'd talk, and then you would come 
down the stairs. And I felt probably like someone who was terminally ill and 
somehow they managed to forget it for a minute. And then it all comes back!

lines, go fuckin' birdwatchin'?

if you take it consistently like you're supposed to. What's on?
Uncle Junior: They said in the guide it's an Italian movie, but even with the 
captions I can't tell what's what. They had Jesus hanging off a helicopter, but 
you could tell it was a dummy.
Bobby Baccalieri: You know who I saw at the bakery?
Uncle Junior: How the fuck could I know?
Bobby Baccalieri: Rosalie Aprile. She said they're having a surprise party for

saginata. It'll still need to be dealt with. This car went through a major 
collision.

Tony Soprano: Where the fuck do you get the balls? I am bendin' over backwards 
tryin' to stay neutral, payin' for fuckin' car seats and you're out there

'cuz I'm sick of you leanin' on this cousin thing and that bad hijack like you 
can do whatever the fuck it is you wanna do 'cuz you went away that night and I 
didn't!
Tony Blundetto: You're the one who keeps bringin' that up, I'm fine with it. 
First of all for the record, I had nothin' to do with this.
Tony Soprano: Don't fuckin' lie to me!!
Tony Blundetto: Even if I was, would you really wanna know, that'd just be 
another problem for you with Johnny right?
Tony Soprano: Aight, look, I know you're not earnin' what you expected and you 
got the twins and Nancy...you're a capable guy. Your mother let it slip one 
time, you got an IQ of 158.
Tony Blundetto: She told you that?

about it.
Tony Blundetto: Lotta good it did me.

Tony Blundetto: Yeah...
Tony Soprano: Look a guy like you, brains, balls, if you'd fuckin' be straight 
with me I could use all that.
Tony Blundetto: Put me in, coach.
Tony Soprano: Aight, we got the casino on Bloomfield Avenue above the hardware 
store. Carlo's guy was runnin' it but he just got diagnosed with the Hodgkins.

Finn DeTrolio: He came onto me alright! Either that, or he wants to kill me.
Meadow Soprano: What?!
Finn DeTrolio: I saw him blowing some security guard in the parkin' lot.
Meadow Soprano: When? What are you talking about!?
Finn DeTrolio: This mornin' I showed up early, I didn't wanna say anythin' but 
I'm really afraid of this guy.
Meadow Soprano: Vito Spatafore is a married man Finn, I seriously doubt he 
wants to kill you.
Finn DeTrolio: Well maybe he wants to fuck me and then kill me!
Meadow Soprano: Wait a minute, is that why you got out the suitcase.
Finn DeTrolio: I am not going back to the site.
Meadow Soprano: Do you have any idea the strings my father pulled to get you 
that job and you just fuckin' quit! I'm gonna hear so much bullshit!!
Finn DeTrolio: So its all about you right?!
Meadow Soprano: Is that all you can say whenever its anythin' to do with my 
feelin's? So you're going back to Mission Viejo?
Finn DeTrolio: I didn't say that!
Meadow Soprano: Why don't you just admit it!? This whole thing. The fight, this 
stuff with Vito, it's really about you not wanting to commit!
Finn DeTrolio: I'm right here, we fucking live together.
Meadow Soprano: But you got out a suitcase!!
Finn DeTrolio: It's my process! Okay? Look you never can tell!!
Meadow Soprano: Your process?!!
Finn DeTrolio: About anything, the future, I was thinking out loud. Well not 
out loud, but in the action of getting out the suitcase I was thinking.
Meadow Soprano: Thinking of leaving!
Finn DeTrolio: No...well yes...but I'm still here...I didn't go.
Meadow Soprano: Fuck you!!
Finn DeTrolio: Right...great...fuck me..there was no abundant intentionality in 
me getting out the suitcase.
Meadow Soprano: I can leave too you know, my friend Hunter's in Montreal!!!
Finn DeTrolio: Do I know!!! With the French roommate guy who was all over your 
ass the time that we visited, you don't think you keep mentioning him every 24 
hours in a minimum.
Meadow Soprano: Because he's thinking of becoming an oral surgeon and you might 
have had a new friend if you hadn't been so obnoxious to him at the club.
Finn DeTrolio: Can we just stop fighting?
Meadow Soprano: You got out a suitcase!!!!
Finn DeTrolio: I'll put it back okay?
%
Meadow Soprano: So it's not about us, but suddenly you're talking about options.
Finn DeTrolio: Don't paraphrase what I said. I said, this point in our lives is 
a transition period forced on us by external events, school is over for me and 
next year for you. These are difficult choices, what you'd rather not have 
choices...thank god for choices!!
Meadow Soprano: Uh! Stop your bullshit! It's really simple! Are we going to 
stay together or not!!!?
Finn DeTrolio: If you want.
Meadow Soprano: That's not what I asked!
Finn DeTrolio: I said I did.
Meadow Soprano: And then you said, how are we going to keep it together through 
four years of dental school for you and probably med school for me!
Finn DeTrolio: Well, its a good question.
Meadow Soprano: But why ask it now, tonight of all times?!! Are you asleep?!!
Finn DeTrolio: No!
Meadow Soprano: You were. And now you're gonna lie like you did about the 
suitcase!
Finn DeTrolio: I did not lie about the suitcase!!
Meadow Soprano: Then what do you call it!?
Finn DeTrolio: I don't know, I explained it. Jesus, you should quit the law 
center, you're like a prosecutor at 4 in the morning. I can't think!!
Meadow Soprano: How can you sleep when we're in the middle of this!!!
Finn DeTrolio: In the middle of what?!! All I said was I didn't wanna go back 
to the job site and maybe I should go home until this thing with Vito blows 
over.
Meadow Soprano: But you didn't ask me to come. You went right to the closet and 
got out your suitcase!

Artie Bucco: I hope you brought your appetite...
Tony Soprano: Why don't you give us a minute. (Artie leaves the table) Well 
that's nice. Invite me to a public place so you can ambush me? You think I 
won't make a scene?
Carmela Soprano: Spare me your outrage, Tony. Accept the fact that I'm moving 
on with my life.
Tony Soprano: Moving on? That's what you were doing after the party last week?
Carmela Soprano: I think you and I both know that didn't change anything.
Tony Soprano: Well first of all we're Italian, we don't believe in divorce. We

Carmela Soprano: Are you listening to yourself? Despite your best efforts, I 
have an attorney who is going to aggressively pursue my custody of A.J. an also 
an equitable distribution of our assets.
Tony Soprano: Our assets?
Carmela Soprano: I am through trying to get you to provide beyond the minimum I 
need to live.
Tony Soprano: Oh so it's fuckin' money? That's all this is to you?
Carmela Soprano: After all we've been through is it so hard to own up to 
anything beyond that bullshit tax return?

(Artie comes back to the table)
Tony Soprano: Go stand over there, I'll call you when I'm ready.(Artie leaves 
again) You want money? How 'bout my forty grand you stole out of the bird 
feeder, that should be plenty, you're such an investment genius.
Carmela Soprano: You want this to get ugly Tony, because these guys live for 
that.
Tony Soprano: What, you think I don't? (gets up to leave, then comes back) The 
only reason you have anything is 'cause of my fuckin' sweat, and you knew every 
step of the way exactly how it works. But you walk around that fuckin' mansion 
and your five-hundred dollar shoes and your diamond rings, and you act like 
butter wouldn't melt in your mouth. And you don't want it to get ugly. Too late.
Carmela Soprano: I want what I am entitled to.
Tony Soprano: You're entitled to shit. (to Artie): She's ready to order.

Janice Soprano: I'd like to punch you in the face?

Phil Leotardo: Take your fuckin' sorrys, and stick in your ass.
Tony Soprano: I could say nothing. Be a heartless prick.
Phil Leotardo: He tried to talk, he couldn't even say his last words. Anybody

Tony Soprano: No.
Phil Leotardo: Well give it time. See if I can't make that happen for you.
Silvio Dante: Whoa whoa whoa...
Tony Soprano: Alright, that's enough.

Tony Soprano: Was that fuckin' necessary? He shouldn't even've been here.

Tony Soprano: My cousin acted alone, I did not sanction this.
Johnny Sack: The 'lone gunman theory'...
Tony Soprano: You know how close he and Angelo were in the can. He flipped the 
fuck out!
Johnny Sack: When he whacked Joey Peeps, what flipped him out that time?
Tony Soprano: W-whaddaya want John, whaddaya want me to say?
Johnny Sack: I want your cousin on a fucking spit!
Tony Soprano: I don't know where he is.
Silvio Dante: Nobody does.

a fuckin' pariah! I gave that fuck pieces of my soul, Adriana. You know what he 
said to me? He said I should have a fuckin' drink!
Adriana La Cerva: When?
Christopher Moltisanti: Up there when we were up in Uncle Pat's farm!
Adriana La Cerva: Well you don't need to listen to him. Isn't that why you have 
a sponsor?
Christopher Moltisanti: Him and Tony B. Breakin' my balls! Teasin' me like when 
I was little. I mean, what kind of fucked up, underminin' shit is that to tell 
someone who's got the disease. You know I could take him out in a second that 
fat fuck! BANG! His kids wouldn't even give a shit!
Adriana La Cerva: Don't talk like that! You're a better man than he is - a 
better person.
Christopher Moltisanti: Fuck all this shit with Paulie and all, you know what 
hurts me worse, right to my heart. Him and our asswipe cousin, that two-faced 
cocksucker. He can get us all killed with New York, and him Tony has to think 
about what to do with him now, after all this shit. Me, he don't need to 
fuckin' think! Well, maybe I need to think! Ever thought of that, you fat 
fuckin' scumbag!!!

Phil Leotardo: We're uh...from Alcoholics Anonymous.

Silvio Dante: I've been your consigliere for a lot of years-
Tony Soprano: Don't go through a fuckin' preamble, just tell me what's on your 
mind!
%
Tony Soprano: My cousin Anthony...went into business for himself. We all know 
this. In a way for which there is no excuse. He's got a problem with rage. He 
disappointed me, Anthony, in ways that I can't even begin ta tell you. And he 
put us all at risk. Irregardless, it's been made clear ta me that if they put 
their hands on him, he will not be dealt with quick. We're talkin' torture. For 
that reason, even if I knew where my cousin was, and I do not, I would not 
deliver him up ta them. I am offerin' him the same protection that I would 
offer any of you in similar circumstances. Now I know what you're gonna say, 
you're gonna say "Hey, Ton', I would never do what he did." God bless, I hope 
not. But we are a family, and even in this fucked up day and age that means 
somethin'. So we're gonna deal with this as a family, together. No matter how 
it affects anybody...personal safety-wise, financially-wise, whatever. I see 
that my nephew isn't here and, uh, it's important he lam it now. It's my desire 
that you circle the wagons, you support him. Until and as such.

Benny Fazio: Fuckin' somethin', this situation, eh?
Silvio Dante: Right.
Christopher Moltisanti: I can't even get down ta Milt's, fence some jewelry.
Benny Fazio: Everybody with eyes in the back o' their head. Shit, I was Tony's 
driver.
Christopher Moltisanti: It's amazing. You want me ta be honest? The favoritism 
Tony still shows for our fuckin' cousin after what he's done? What does Tony B. 
have on this guy? And I'm supposed ta maybe take a bullet for this skeeve.
Silvio Dante: After all your uncle's done for you? I need ta get into specifics?
%
Eugene Pontecorvo: (next to Benny Fazio's battered body in the hospital) This 
is fucked up.
Vito Spatafore: What do ya wanna do about it?
Eugene Pontecorvo: What do I wanna do about it? I want that man there ta do 
somethin' about it. (referring to Tony) I want 'im ta give us the okay ta drive 
over ta Brooklyn, clean some fuckin' timepieces over there.
Vito Spatafore: Tony Blundetto whacked the brother of a captain. Tony tried ta 
strike at them again, we should take him out.

Tony Soprano: (digging with shovel) Halfway ta China...there's nuthin' here.
Uncle Junior: Forty thousand I had. My share of the Bohack's haul from the 
seventies.
Tony Soprano: Did you wrap it right? It gets moldy...it could've disintegrated.
Uncle Junior: Wrap what?
Tony Soprano: The money.
Uncle Junior: He knows I need that money for my fuckin' retrial.
Tony Soprano: Who?
Uncle Junior: You know who.
Tony Soprano: No I don't know who, that's why I asked you.
Uncle Junior: Malanga.
Tony Soprano: Will you stop with that. Pussy Malanga's dead...six years now. I 
should dig him up already!

Silvio Dante: He was a good kid, Raymond.
Tony Soprano: The best.

died of Lou Gehrig's disease?

Eugene Pontecorvo: He's the boss Deanne.

stick 'em in your ass.
Government Agent: No...repeat the sentence.
Uncle Junior: (yelling) What is this person talkin' about?!
Perry Benedek: These people are trying to establish for the government, that if 
you shot Anthony Soprano, which we're not conceding, that it certainly wasn't 
intentional. That you were confused and disoriented.
Government Agent: Don't coach him, please.
Uncle Junior: My nephew Anthony?!
Perry Benedek: That's why you're here in custody.
Uncle Junior: Where's Mel?
Perry Benedek: You dismissed Mr. Melvoin as your attorney and hired me, because 
of his paralyzed hand from his stroke, it made you nervous.
Uncle Junior: If somebody shot my nephew, it was him himself. He's a depression 
case.

Carlo Gervasi: What do we do about Junior?
Christopher Moltisanti: He's in jail. That puts him out of our reach.
Vito Spatafore: Not necessarily.
Larry Boy Barese: He's a demented old fuck. I say we do nothin'. Let 'im rot, 
sever all ties. End this embarrassment right now.
Vito Spatafore: He "Marvin Gayed" his own nephew, the boss o' this family.
Paulie Walnuts: What happens ta Junior is Tony's call.
Bobby Baccilieri: That's right.
Vito Spatafore: Bobby, all due respect, where the fuck were you that night? Why 
was the skipper babysittin' Junior?
Bobby Baccilieri: I had other family obligations. Ask my wife. Tony volunteered.

Vito Spatafore: (about Eugene Pontecorvo committing suicide) I knew 'im better

Got enough on his plate.

Vito Spatafore: You would never heard about it without my information.
Paulie Walnuts: Big help. It was fuckin' mayham. You said the place was empty. 
Doc says I need an ultrasound on my groin and balls.
Vito Spatafore: Sil, you wanna weigh in here?
Silvio Dante: It breaks half and half. You both kick Tony's to me to deal with.
Paulie Walnuts: I'll have it for you Sil, the whole eighty K.
Vito Spatafore: Ho, ho, ho. Eighty K? How's that twenty percent of a million?
Paulie Walnuts: Have a cookie, you're delirious. It was seven fifty, tops.
Vito Spatafore: Fuck it all, Paulie. Tommy cased that shithole.
Silvio Dante: What's with the fuckin' accountin' out there? That's a hundred 
grand a piece. You got it? We're lookin' after Carmela.

again.
J.T. Dolan: I can't write a feature now. I just landed a staff job.
Christopher Moltisanti: People are seein' huge profits with these digital 
horror movies. Douchebags who never made a film before.
Benny Fazio: That "Saw" thing, four hundred grand ta make, took in a hundred 
mil worldwide.
J.T. Dolan: I'm a hundred percent well? I deliver this script, I owe you 
nothin'?
Christopher Moltisanti: You hear this dude? Hundred percent well...he's a bad 
boy huh, with that lingo? Real fuckin' dark character. My idea is "Saw" meets 
"Godfather Two." Proven track record, both genres. Young wiseguy, assassin, 
gets betrayed by his people. They whack 'im, leave his body parts in dumpsters 
all around the city. Long story short, he is put back together by science, or 
maybe it's supernatural. And he gets fuckin' payback on everyone who fucked 'im 
over, includin' the cunt he was engaged to. She was gettin' porked by his boss 
the night the hero was killed. We'll have a meeting tomorrow. We hear what 
you've fleshed out before we go ta script. Bing. Two Thirty. Don't make me come 
look fer you.

Vito Spatafore: Fuck took you so long?
Paulie Walnuts: I had ta get it together, didn't I? We gotta get that cut ta 
her now.
Vito Spatafore: Easy. That's a fuckin' guilty move.
Paulie Walnuts: Tony's conscious. You capisce? Everybody and his mother was in

they said? Maybe he's expectin' that money.
Vito Spatafore: Jesus Christ.

misquoted me.
Meadow Soprano: Holy shit...
Carmela Soprano: Well, of course they did! That's what they do! Which is why I 
and everybody else told you, "Don't talk to the press!"
Anthony Junior: Yeah well you're the one who looked like a total asshole. 
Draggin' me around like I was five years old.
Carmela Soprano: You are a cross to bear. That's all you are. To your father,

aunt. Turns out she's my mother.
Nucci Gaultieri: No, that's not true.

Nucci Gaultieri: Paulie!
Paulie Walnuts: It's true, isn't it? Isn't it? Son of a bitch!
Nucci Gaultieri: Oh how I dreaded this day.
Paulie Walnuts: I gave you everything! I gave you a son's love, all under false 
pretenses.
Nucci Gaultieri: No!
Paulie Walnuts: You're a fraud and a phony! And she's even worse. She's a 
whore. My mother's a fuckin' whore!
Nucci Gaultieri: Don't say that! She was a young girl. She wanted to be a nun, 
but she got in trouble.

Rudy Diaz: I was looking for proof of insurance. I was only doin' my job.
Tony Soprano: They heard a lot o' that at Nuremberg. You owe me two K. It was 
gone from my wallet.
Rudy Diaz: I don't have that kind o' money.

Charles Cinelli: Jason, we shook hands. A deal's a deal.
Jason Barone: There's lifetime employees who expect compensation. It's only 
equitable. Now if you're willing to take care of that, maybe we could still

Charles Cinelli: Tony Soprano, right? Fuck that and fuck him. He's your problem.
Jason Barone: Look, the numbers just don't work.
Helen Barone: (from afar) Jason! I'm going to the buffet table.
Jason Barone: Be right there mom. If I give Tony what he wants, I lose money on 
the sale. I can't do that to my mom.
Charles Cinelli: Kid, you work it out any way you want, but nobody's backin' 
out of the deal.
Jason Barone: Mr. Cinelli, I'm sorry, but the bottom line is, I'm not selling 
the company to you. There are other buyers out there. Tony was quite clear 
about that.
Charles Cinelli: I'll tell you the fuckin' bottom line, laddy buck. The Barone 
routes are now Cinelli routes. That's that.

grand, every goddamn month! And if you ever mention a word o' this ta Tony,

trigger till the bullets come out your eyes. (Paulie kicks Jason)
Jason Barone: Ah. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh.....

Prosecutor: The defendant's request for temporary release from federal custody 
to attend his daughter's wedding is ludicrous. Mr. Sacrimoni is a known member

Defendant: I notice you're wearing a wedding ring, Miss Vaughn. Was your father 
at your wedding?
Prosecutor: My father wasn't awaiting trial on forty seven RICO predicates

Dr. Jennifer Melfi: You were shot Anthony, by a member of your family.
Tony Soprano: I know.
Dr. Jennifer Melfi: And unless I know absolutely nothing about what I'm doing, 
I think you and I'll have a lot to talk about. Are you familiar with the term,

Tony Soprano: I get it, okay? My uncle tried ta kill me...for the second time. 
Three strikes and I'm out right?

Phil Leotardo: I'll tell ya one thing and I'm not ashamed ta say it. My 
estimation of John Sacrimoni as a man just fuckin' plummeted.
Tony Soprano: Give 'im a break, will ya? It's an emotional day...
Phil Leotardo: Ta cry like a woman? It's a fuckin' disgrace.
Paulie Walnuts: His fuckin' coach turned into a pumpkin. Heh heh.
Phil Leotardo: Well, even Cinderella didn't cry...
Tony Soprano: Look, when it comes to daughters, all bets are off. I've seen 
tougher guys than John cry at weddings.
Phil Leotardo: Yeah, well let me ask you this. If they can make him cry and if 
he's that weak, what the fuck else can they make 'im do?
Christopher Moltisanti: I gotta agree with Phil, Ton'.
Tony Soprano: Oh, you do, do ya?

Christopher Moltisanti: You are not gonna fuckin' believe this.
James Zancone: Vito Spatafore's an ass muncher.
Paulie Walnuts: Oh!!!
Silvio Dante: What?
Tony Soprano: What'd you just say?
James Zancone: I'm sorry, it's true.
Christopher Moltisanti: We ran into this kid. Vito was spotted in a fag bar in 
New York.
Tony Soprano: By who?
Christopher Moltisanti: The kid's cousin. Allegedly.
James Zancone: Probably bullshit.
Silvio Dante: He's a married man.
Paulie Walnuts: With a goomar!
Tony Soprano: Aight, back up a second. What'd the kid say exactly?
Christopher Moltisanti: The kid's cousin, Sal Iacuzzo-
Carlo Gervasi: From Yonkers, I know him.
Christopher Moltisanti: Sal was at this place in the city, supposedly on 
business. He saw Vito holdin' hands with a guy in nipple rings.
James Zancone: You're leavin' out the best part.
Christopher Moltisanti: He was wearin' a motorcycle outfit, like the guy in the 
Village People with the leather hat and the vest.
James Zancone: Chaps too.
Paulie Walnuts: I dunno. Fucking slander, ask me.
Tony Soprano: All right, lets take this in the back.
James Zancone: Yeah, that's what Vito did.
Tony Soprano: (to James) You can go. (Everyone except for James goes to the 
back)
Paulie Walnuts: Tell you one thing, if it was me this kid was spreadin' rumors 
about, he'd have somethin' up his own ass. And it wouldn't be no cock either.
Carlo Gervasi: That's the point though. This guy Sal, I know him. He's a friend 
o' ours.
Christopher Moltisanti: I fuckin' called it, long time ago.
Tony Soprano: You knew Vito was a ricchione'?
Christopher Moltisanti: Yes.
Tony Soprano: When?
Christopher Moltisanti: I never said it, but I knew.
Tony Soprano: Eh, get the fuck out, huh. And, and, Enough o' this rush ta 
judgment. For all we know this fuckin' Sal guy's got a hard-on for Vito. (Chris 
laughs) Oh, you think this is funny, huh? There's a man's reputation at stake 
here.
Paulie Walnuts: A married man, with kids.
Carlo Gervasi: Nah, that don't mean shit. Elton John was married.
Silvio Dante: Yeah, Rock Hudson too. I think.
Christopher Moltisanti: So, whatta we gotta do Ton', actually see him take it 
in the ass?
Tony Soprano: Get Vito on the phone. (Patsy tries to call Vito)
Silvio Dante: You know, he called me the other night. Three o'clock in the 
morning after the wedding.
Tony Soprano: And?
Silvio Dante: Eh, honestly, it was weird. He wanted to know what was goin' on.
Christopher Moltisanti: He was fuckin' fishin'. See if we heard.
Patsy Parisi: Straight ta voice mail. (Patsy hangs up)
Silvio Dante: Ton', I mean, he represents us.
Tony Soprano: I'm gonna condemn the man off the word o' some fuckin' douchebag 
from Yonkers.
Patsy Parisi: I could care less, basically.
Paulie Walnuts: Yeah? Maybe you're a flambe? (Patsy sticks his middle finger at 
Paulie)
Carlo Gervasi: Fuckin' nauseating. It's up to me, I'd drag Vito behind my 
fuckin' car right now.
Tony Soprano: Oh, will you take it easy over there, fuckin' Judge Roy Bean?
Silvio Dante: One of my bar girls knows his goomar. We'll check with her. Maybe 
she's seen 'im and knows where he is. Loren. (Patsy leaves)
Carlo Gervasi: Think about it, though, Ton'. Sudden weight loss.
Paulie Walnuts: AIDS?
Tony Soprano: Nobody's got AIDS. Now I don't wanna hear that word in here again.

Corky Caporale: Come on.
Christopher Moltisanti: Somebody started a joke. I won't mention any names. 
There's no truth to it.
Corky Caporale: Oh.
Christopher Moltisanti: It's a fuckin' captain you're talkin' about. People 
went to see 'im, he was down the shore with his goomar.
Corky Caporale: So it's bullshit then.
Christopher Moltisanti: As soon as he saw 'em, he took off like a bat outta 
hell.
Corky Caporale: Fuck. (They laugh)
Christopher Moltisanti: You didn't hear it from me.
Corky Caporale: It could be a mid-life thing.

Tony Soprano: He's a fa-ag!
Dr. Jennifer Melfi: And?
Tony Soprano: Now what am I supposed ta do?
Dr. Jennifer Melfi: About what?
Tony Soprano: I know what. They're born that way, right? It's not their fault. 
Frankly, I think they go about in pity for themselves.
Dr. Jennifer Melfi: I don't think they see it as a fault.
Tony Soprano: In your circle, I'm sure you got all kinds of uh, gays, and uh, 
trans-whatevers of all stripes. But not where I come from.
Dr. Jennifer Melfi: You personally, how do you feel about homosexuality?
Tony Soprano: I find it disgusting. Men kissin' men, holdin' hands in the 
street. Every fuckin' TV show now, they rub your nose in it. Although, that, 
the lesbian thing with the, uh, Jennifer Beals, it's not bad. She a dyke in 
real life? I don't give too much of a shit, what people do behind closed doors 
with the consentin' adults. Although, don't forget, I'm a strict Catholic. I 
agree with that Senator Sanitorium, says if we let this stuff go too far, 
pretty soon we'll be fuckin' dogs.
Dr. Jennifer Melfi: I hear a lot of ambivalence.
Tony Soprano: This guy that got outed, look, the guys that look for me are 
askin' fer head. (pause) His head, what the fuck. You know, him and me, we're 
in the construction business. Now some o' these union old-timers, the 
contractors, they're not gonna wanna be seen with him. And I'm talkin' huge 
deals, major fuckin' dollars.
Dr. Jennifer Melfi: A lot of your circle must have done jail time. They can't 
be strangers to male-male sexual contact.
Tony Soprano: Well you get a pass fer that.
Dr. Jennifer Melfi: Well, that's nice.
Tony Soprano: Well, what are ya gonna do? There's no women there. Y-y-you're 
there five, ten years. And just for the record, my, uhh, incarceration was very 
short term, so I never had any need for any anal-you know.
Dr. Jennifer Melfi: So this fellow who's been outed, what's he saying?
Tony Soprano: You think I'm lyin' don't you? About when I was in jail.
Dr. Jennifer Melfi: I've given you no indication I think you're lying.
Tony Soprano: What the fuck, I suppose somethin' inside me says God bless, 
a'salut'. Who gives a shit? I mean, I had a second chance. Why shouldn't he?
Dr. Jennifer Melfi: Part of your new outlook?
Tony Soprano: Maybe.
Dr. Jennifer Melfi: I salute it then.
Tony Soprano: Tall fuckin' order, I'll tell ya that.
Dr. Jennifer Melfi: How so?
Tony Soprano: Well, you can talk about every day bein' a gift and uh, stoppin' 
ta smell the roses, but regular life's got a way pickin' away at it. Your 
house. The shit you own. It drags you down. Your kids. What they want. One bad 
idea after another. Just tryin' ta work a cell phone menu is enough to make you 
scream.

Silvio Dante: Lemme ask you a question. Before he cornered you in the 
porta-potty, when the security guard was suckin' him off-
Finn DeTrolio: Whoah one sec, it-it was the other way around.
Paulie Walnuts: What?!
Finn DeTrolio: Vito was blowing the security guard.
Paulie Walnuts: Son of a bitch!!!
Carlo Gervasi: Catchin', not pitchin'?
Finn DeTrolio: He's not gonna know I told you?
Paulie Walnuts: You ain't gonna have no problem from Vito, believe me.
Finn DeTrolio: What are ya gonna do?
Christopher Moltisanti: It'll be okay. Get him ta pay for some therapy.
Tony Soprano: (to Finn) Look, why don't you, uh, go out front, just get 
yourself a sandwich, any kind ya like huh? Soda. And, when we're done here, 
somebody'll take you back. Alright. (Finn leaves)
Christopher Moltisanti: (laughs) I wanna kill the fat faggot myself! Be a 
fuckin' honor. Cut off his pisciatil' and feed it to 'im.
Tony Soprano: There can be no mistake now.
Paulie Walnuts: I can't believe I stuck up for 'im! I feel like I've been 
stabbed in the heart.
Bobby Baccilieri: Well, we can't have 'im here in our social club no more. I 
mean, that much I do know.
Carlo Gervasi: Social club? He's gotta go!
Tony Soprano: I wanna think about it.
Bobby Baccilieri: Yeah, I-I don't know.
Paulie Walnuts: (Paulie stands up) What the fuck?! What is there ta think about?
Tony Soprano: Sit down. (to Paulie)
Paulie Walnuts: Fuck that! I'll say it again! What the fuck is there ta think 
about?
Tony Soprano: You gonna take care of his kids, huh, after he's gone?
Christopher Moltisanti: It's true. They didn't do nothin'. Poor little guys.
Tony Soprano: Now sit down. (to Paulie)
Paulie Walnuts: I'm sorry if I yelled T, it's just, how much more betrayal can 
I take?
Christopher Moltisanti: (laughing) Vito a fag. Big construction tycoon. Ton', 
when he was always talkin' about "greasin' the union," who knew, that's what he 
meant? (does jerk off notion with his hand and Patsy Parisi laughs hard in 
response)
Tony Soprano: Alright, this stays in these four walls. Understood?

Finn DeTrolio: You weren't there for the "grand inquisition" about Vito.
Meadow Soprano: Uh, I knew it. I'm picking the fight.
Finn DeTrolio: I was in the back of a butcher shop with your Uncle Paulie, 
ratting out a guy, I don't really even know. I mean, what do you think's gonna 
happen to Vito, for being gay? And don't give me any of that "poverty of the 
Mezzogiorno" bullshit. We're in fucking Caldwell, New Jersey, and you're on 
your high horse about justice? They are gonna mete it out themselves.

Tony Soprano: Oh!
Artie Bucco: Jesus fuckin' Christ. How could you pull that scam at my place?
Tony Soprano: Come on, you know I woulda never let that happen if I'd known.
Artie Bucco: You're innocent. I get it. I'm just another victim of "Benny 
Fazio: Criminal Mastermind."
Tony Soprano: That's right. The moment you found out, instead of puttin' him in 
the ER, you shoulda come to me. He says he's gonna kill you Artie.
Artie Bucco: I can't take American Express now Tony. You know what that means? 
I have to start with the fuckin' "two-fors." My accountant insisted, ya happy? 
Life's not fair, right I know. But somehow, I believed my dad's crap about 
honest work. He used ta say ta me, "You'll see, pay's off in the end." What a 
joke.

Benny Fazio: Hey Artie. Come here.

tellin' her what to do, last time I checked, that's the way it works.
Benny Fazio: She thinks you want her ta cry. I said not true.
Artie Bucco: She told you that? 'Cuz you two talk all the time...
Benny Fazio: Yeah, so what?
Artie Bucco: So maybe you should hire her.
Benny Fazio: I know how to treat people.
Artie Bucco: You're a people person, obviously.
Benny Fazio: I am. And when they're good to me, they get treats. And when 
they're not, well I got this severence thing I do, it's a complete break

seriously...Vito...what's being done about 'im?

Phil Leotardo: Marie is a victim. Her children are victims. They've done 
nothing. And they're forced to live with the shame and humiliation. I gotta be 
frank, in your father's day, we wouldn't be havin' this conversation. A finook 
in his crew, he knew how ta handle that.

foremost, there's always a body. And ninety nine out of a hundred, and this 
comes straight from my cop buddies, it happens either in the bedroom or in the 
kitchen. He killed her, believe me with the forensics they got nowadays, 
the...uh...fibers, we'd know about it.

Tony Soprano: That's exactly my point. If they thought he did it, how fast do 
ya think they'd haul his ass in? Sour grapes, Carm. He dumps her daughter, all 
of a sudden he's Scott fuckin' Peterson.

Tony Soprano: You know what I mean. She was a sweet girl, Ade. But the two of 
them together was a toxic relationship.

minds. Now for whatever reason, certain incidents have expired lately that in 
addition to being dangerous could have an adverse impact on our respective

Tony Soprano: So what the fuck would I know about that?
Phil Leotardo: Well as coincidence would have it, he was last seen in New 
Jersey.
Tony Soprano: So was the Hindenburg. Maybe you wanna look into that too.
Little Carmine Lupertazzi: Tony, please. Phil. We're gettin' off point. I grew 
up in this, guys. And I just lost my friend Rusty. And for reasons I will 
discern in time, believe me. If there's one thing my father taught me, it's 
this...a pint of blood costs more than a gallon of gold. My business...all of 
our businesses...this infighting's costing money.
Tony Soprano: I'm willin' ta move forward. Let the past be bygones.
Phil Leotardo: Fine with me.
Little Carmine Lupertazzi: A wise decision...on both your parts. Now what I'd 
love to see is a truce. Wipe the slate clean. The no-shows. The wire room. 
Vito...put it all behind us.
Tony Soprano: Yeah...
Little Carmine Lupertazzi: Your brother Billy, whatever happened there...
Tony Soprano: All right then...
Phil Leotardo: "Whatever happened there?"
Little Carmine Lupertazzi: The shooting...
Phil Leotardo: "Whatever happened there?"
Little Carmine Lupertazzi: God rest his soul, huh?
Phil Leotardo: I'll tell you what fuckin' happened. This piece of shit's 
cousin...
Tony Soprano: Calm down Phil.
Phil Leotardo: ...Put six bullets in the kid without any provocation whatsoever!
Tony Soprano: My cousin's dead.
Phil Leotardo: Fuck you!
Little Carmine Lupertazzi: Phil, hey we were makin' headway here. I didn't mean 
to say...
Phil Leotardo: Fuck what you meant, cocksucka! Come on! (Phil and his gang 
leaves)
Tony Soprano: Jesus Christ, Carmine. What the fuck? Why would you possibly 
bring that up?
%
Gerry Torciano: Don't get me wrong, I loved Dom more than anybody. My point is 
we don't know if Tony was behind this.
Phil Leotardo: It's payback for Vito.
Gerry Torciano: So why the fuck did they blow up the wire room?
Albie Cianflone: Balls on this prick...
Butch DeConcini: To blow up a store...you call that balls? Balls is you look a 
guy in the eye while you jam a ice pick through his lung.
Albie Cianflone: I meant balls as in "nerve," "gall."
Butch DeConcini: I know what the fuck you meant. Far as I'm concerned, this is 
like nine eleven. Tony wanted our attention? Fine. He got our attention. Now we 
wipe 'im off the planet.
Phil Leotardo: You know that fat cocksucker says I look like the Shah of Iran?
Butch DeConcini: Who does?
Gerry Torciano: Tony...
Albie Cianflone: I never got that at all...
Phil Leotardo: Fat piece o' shit.
Butch DeConcini: It's irrelevant, Phil. But he's testin' you...all the time. 
And you keep indulgin' him.
Phil Leotardo: You're right. But whack a boss? I won't do that.
Butch DeConcini: It's been done before.
Phil Leotardo: And it was wrong then.
Butch DeConcini: Eye for an eye then, huh? Pick somebody over there.
%
Dr. Jennifer Melfi: You came out of that shooting feeling each day is a gift. 
Well, this is a corollary to that.
Tony Soprano: A what?
Dr. Jennifer Melfi: You don't have to eat every dish of rigatoni. You don't 
have to fuck every female you meet.
%
Carmela Soprano: I told you. I had another dream about Ade in Paris. A French 
policeman told me she was dead and I had to tell her.
Tony Soprano: I know, Carm. Pepe Le Pew.

Julianna Skiff: (after sex with Chris) You ruined my dress.
Christopher Moltisanti: Save it. Like Monica Lewinsky. Show your friends how 
hard you made me come.

Tony Soprano: (About killing a person) You know, come ta think of it, you never 
popped your cherry in that regard, right?
Bobby Baccilieri: No.
Tony Soprano: Yet your old man was the fuckin' terminator.
%
Bobby Baccilieri: (about playing Monopoly) You know, the Parker Brothers took 
time ta think this all out. I think we should respect that.
Janice Soprano: Fuck the Parker Brothers. Just play the game.
%
Bobby Baccilieri: (After Tony makes a joke about Janice) Oh! What about my 
wife!?
Tony Soprano: You married her.
Bobby Baccilieri: She's my home. No more talkin' like that!
Janice Soprano: It's okay Bobby.
Bobby Baccilieri: Stay outta this! You Sopranos. You go too far.
Tony Soprano: Alright, you know, Jan. He's right, I'm sorry. I crossed the 
line, I apologize...won't happen again.
%
Janice Soprano: (After Bobby beats Tony up) What the fuck were you thinking?
Bobby Baccilieri: You're my wife. He insulted you.
Janice Soprano: I'm a big girl. I can take care o' myself. Oh God, he is head 
of the family. Do you think he's just gonna wake up tomorrow and forget about 
this?
%
Janice Soprano: (looking at Tony sitting outside after getting beat up by 
Bobby) Fuckin' look at him out there.
Bobby Baccilieri: What?
Janice Soprano: I've seen that sitting in the chair thing.
Bobby Baccilieri: Come on...people sit in chairs...
%
Gerry Torciano: All due respect, he's a great guy Doc, but boss material?
Silvio Dante: Important thing is we all work together, whoever winds up in the 
driver's seat.
Gerry Torciano: Phil will, I'll never get it. The man was my mentor, was right 
there for the taking.
Silvio Dante: His heart Gerry, what's he gonna do?
Gerry Torciano: That's my point though. What you just said. Johnny goes away, 
it's Phil's turn in the driver's seat and his heart gives out.
Silvio Dante: Right.
Gerry Torciano: His heart.
Silvio Dante: I know, what?
Gerry Torciano: It's a metaphor. He lost his balls is what I'm sayin'.
Silvio Dante: Just say it then. Walt fuckin' Whitman over here. (Their goomars 
come by) Ladies.
Gerry Torciano: Hey.
Silvio Dante: You alright?
Gerry Torciano: How you doin'?
Goomar: Should we get some more wine?
Gerry Torciano: Where's this fuckin' waiter, on sabbatical?
Silvio Dante: What's the name o' that sangovaise we had at quadrugate, huh, the 
night you- (Gerry Torciano gets gunned down by an assassin)
%
Tony Soprano: So how was Florida?
Phil Leotardo: Hot and sticky...like my balls.
%
Warren Feldman: (Johnny lies in bed) I don't know if you heard but...Gerry 
Torciano. He was hit last week in Brooklyn.
Johnny Sack: Who?
Warren Feldman: Gerry Torciano. Was all over the news. They whacked 'im in some 
restaurant. Did you know 'im?
Johnny Sack: Yeah...uh...um...good guy. So hard to breathe.
%
Christopher Moltisanti: The whole sequence with Sally Boy bangin' the fiance. 
You gotta tell Tony that was your idea.
J.T. Dolan: It wasn't my idea.
Christopher Moltisanti: What are you, fuckin' stupid now? He probably thinks I 
put it in there to embarrass him.
J.T. Dolan: Why did you put it in there?
Christopher Moltisanti: It was an idea. I don't know. Who knows where they 
fuckin' come from. Isaac Newton invented gravity 'cause some asshole hit 'im 
with an apple.
J.T. Dolan: It's bad enough that I don't get credit for my own ideas. Now I'm 
supposed ta take responsibilty for some shit that's gonna get me in trouble. 
Fuck that man. (Christopher lifts an award from J.T.'s counter)
Christopher Moltisanti: Human-itis award...? What's that?
J.T. Dolan: Humanitas. From the Paulus Brothers, for writing themes of socially 
redeeming- (Christopher slams the award on J.T.'s head) Ow!
Christopher Moltisanti: Look out the window! You see a fuckin' Hollywood sign 
out there? Maybe you talk ta your agent like that, but don't ever get fuckin' 
snippy on me again.
%
Phil Leotardo: That cocksuckin' piece o' shit, Tony Soprano's cousin, I can't 
even say his name, murdered Billy. And what did I do about it? My 
weakness...sometimes I think it's in my DNA. My family took shit from the 
Amerigans the minute we get off the boat.
Butch DeConcini: Come on, fuck you talkin' about?
Phil Leotardo: Leotardo, that's my fuckin' legacy...no more Butchy...no more o' 
this.

Carter Chong: Once in third grade, I got a ninety six on my spelling test, 
highest mark in the class, I was so proud. I brought it home to show my 
dad...what happened ta the other four points, he says. (Carter takes a pause) 
Fuck you! Fuck you! (Carter slams his fists together)

Jameel: Autographed pictures of the man who capped Tony Soprano? Shit, them

Patient: (Junior is playing checkers with Carter) Heh. Checkers. The thinking 
man's game.
Uncle Junior: You lookin' for a smack in the fuckin' mouth.
Supervisor: Corrado. Language please.
Uncle Junior: What do you want?
Patient: If you'd move, perhaps I can reach the chess set.
Uncle Junior: And if I don't, what the fuck you gonna do then?
Patient: You don't intimidate me.
Supervisor: Corrado?
Uncle Junior: You're lucky she's here you little prick.
Patient: Naturally, you're only tough when there's an authority figure nearby 
so things won't go too far. Oh, how the mighty have fallen- (Uncle Junior beats 
the crap out of the patient) Ahhhh! Ahh!
Supervisor: Corrado!!!
Carter Chong: Get 'im! Get 'im!
Uncle Junior: How do ya like that, huh, fuckin' tough guy?! How do ya like 
that?! I'm gonna kill this prick!
%
Mrs. Chong: How are you feeling?
Carter Chong: Fine.
Mrs. Chong: Maybe you can clear something up. Dr. Mendel says you've been 
acting aggressively toward other patients.
Carter Chong: First of all, that is total fucking bullshit.
Mrs. Chong: Carter.
Carter Chong: And secondly, why don't you just lead off with that?
Mrs. Chong: What are you talking about?
Carter Chong: Instead of pretending you give a shit how I feel.
Mrs. Chong: Now apparently, you are becoming a bully. Dr. Mendel feels you're 
modeling your actions on the wrong people.
Carter Chong: Really, like who?
Mrs. Chong: You know who. That gangster. (Referring to Uncle Junior)
Carter Chong: You of all people should know not to believe what you read in the 
paper...all that crap they wrote about daddy.
Mrs. Chong: That was the Wall Street Journal. It was entirely different.
Carter Chong: It's never enough, is it? My whole time at M.I.T., you told me, 
get out and make friends, now I finally do learn to assert myself a 
little...suddenly that's a negative!

Tony Soprano: Listen, I gotta bring this up.
Phil Leotardo: A favor already?
Tony Soprano: 'Scuse me?
Phil Leotardo: Anthony, you always have business on your mind. Take a night. 
Smell the cognac.
Tony Soprano: Marie Spatafore came ta see me. She wants a hundred grand ta 
relocate on the count o' Vito Junior already has his own social worker.
Phil Leotardo: Pattie told me there was doin's. I guess the turd doesn't fall 
far from the faggot's ass.
Tony Soprano: That's beautifully put. But, you're family right? Cousins?
Phil Leotardo: What can you do, throw money at the problem?
Tony Soprano: Well somebody's gonna.
Phil Leotardo: I'll talk ta the kid. Set 'im right.
Tony Soprano: Good.

Tony Soprano: I don't know...I look at my key guys...Paulie, Christopher, my 
brother-in-law, what's number one on their agenda, you know? They're all 
fuckin' murderers for chrissakes.

Hesh Rabkin: Did you hear the one about the Jewish terrorist? He was gonna 
hijack a plane but he didn't wanna use his miles.

Tony Soprano: (to Carlo Gervasi) Maybe you should start suckin' cock instead o' 
watching TV land, 'cause Vito brought in three times what you do on 
construction. Yeah! And I didn't have this fuckin' problem!
%
Bobby Baccilieri: Speakin' o' loads. Hear the latest on Vito Junior.
Christopher Moltisanti: What?
Tony Soprano: Marie called. He got expelled 'cause he took a shit in the shower 
in gym class.
Paulie Walnuts: Oh!!!
Christopher Moltisanti: That sick little fuck!
Tony Soprano: You should see 'im. The makeup. Now without school, Marie says 
he's shut in his room all day.
Christopher Moltisanti: Probably thinkin' about how ta pull a Columbine.
%
Carmela Soprano: Anthony?
Anthony Junior: What?
Carmela Soprano: I am making French Toast.
Anthony Junior: I'm not hungry. Jesus, how many times are you gonna ask me?
Carmela Soprano: You heard the term "Comfort Food." Maybe it'll make you feel 
better.
Anthony Junior: I know this is hard for you to believe, but food may not be the 
answer to every problem.
Tony Soprano: Well, neither is actin' like a whiny little bitch.

Christopher Moltisanti: Listen, I gotta talk ta you!
Tony Soprano: Now?
Christopher Moltisanti: It can't wait T, this fuckin' Paulie!
Bobby Baccilieri: What happened?
Christopher Moltisanti: He sent his idiot nephew and Jason Molinaro ta my 
father in law's store. They boosted a power to power source.
Tony Soprano: They did?
Christopher Moltisanti: Yeah. Not exactly, Al caught 'em while they were there.
Tony Soprano: So, they did or did not take the source?
Christopher Moltisanti: They did. Under false pretense.
Tony Soprano: And this is what you couldn't wait ta talk ta me about?
Christopher Moltisanti: They broke inta the guy's store T!
Tony Soprano: Yeah, I hear ya, I get it. But we're in the middle o' talkin' 
about an ongoing potentially multi million dollar proposition here Christopher.
Christopher Moltisanti: It ain't the money Ton'.
Tony Soprano: Oh really? Well I'm glad ya feel that way. Power ta drills, you

Tony Soprano: (on phone) Alright, listen. Sweetheart, there's been an accident, 
We were comin' back from the city and Christopher's dead.
Carmela Soprano: (on phone) (Gasps) Oh my God!!!
Tony Soprano: Alright...Carm...
Carmela Soprano: What happened?
Tony Soprano: He drove off the road...and...and...and the car flipped over 
and...look, I'll tell you in detail.
Carmela Soprano: Are you okay?
Tony Soprano: I just banged my knee, you know the one from High School, I'm 
fine, but...he wasn't wearin' a belt.
Carmela Soprano: So where are you, Saint Claire's.
Tony Soprano: Listen, they're gonna call Kelli, if they haven't

Tony Soprano: Get me a scotch.
Meadow Soprano: Are you serious?
Tony Soprano: Yeah. And have one yourself.
%
Tony Soprano: You alright?
Paulie Walnuts: I know I had my differences with that kid...but maybe I didn't 
do right by him neither. If you were his dad, I was his Dutch uncle. And what 
the fuck did I do but get pissed off? Fight with him over cocksuckin' fuckin' 
money. And break his balls when he tried not to have a drink...or a little 
taste o' snow.
Tony Soprano: It's over Paulie.
%
Tony Soprano: You know what? This is bullshit.
Dr. Jennifer Melfi: What?
Tony Soprano: I haven't been able ta tell anybody this, but I'm fuckin' 
relieved.
Dr. Jennifer Melfi: Really?
Tony Soprano: He was a tremendous drag on my emotions...on my thoughts about 
the future. I mean, ta begin with...every mornin' I wake up thinkin' "is today 
the day that one o' my best friends is gonna dime me ta the FBI." And a weak 
fuckin' snivelin', lyin' drug addict? That's the worst kind o' bet. The biggest 
blunder o' my career is now gone. And I don't have ta be confronted by that 
fact no more. And as a relative, a friend, someone you can count on... (Tony 
does a non-caring notion with his hand)
Dr. Jennifer Melfi: I see.
Tony Soprano: Let me tell you somethin', I murdered friends before, even 
relatives. My cousin Tony...my best friend, Puss'...but this...

Tony Soprano: That's it?
Phil Leotardo: What else would you like me ta say?
Tony Soprano: Come on Phil, what...what's the problem? I come here on good 
faith. I make a reasonable counter.
Phil Leotardo: Which I considered...and rejected.
Tony Soprano: Do we need ta talk in private?
Phil Leotardo: For what?
Tony Soprano: Okay then...in front of everybody. When you were sick, in the 
hospital, we talked. We shared a...uh...an understanding about life.
Phil Leotardo: This is business Anthony.
Tony Soprano: Yeah I...I know. But I'm talkin' ta ya here on a human level. 
There's a limit Phil. Come on. Point where business bleeds into other shit. 
Feelings make things financially unfeasible.
Phil Leotardo: Charles Schwab over here. (everyone laughs)
Tony Soprano: So that's it? No leeway, no compromise, just stupid fuckin' jokes.
Phil Leotardo: You want compromise? How's this? Twenty years in the can, I 
wanted Manicott. I compromised. I ate grilled cheese off the radiator instead. 
I wanted ta fuck a woman but I compromised...I jacked off in a tissue. You see 
where I'm goin'?
Tony Soprano: Yeah... (Tony leaves)
%
Tony Soprano: Alright, lets dispense with the five hundred pound elephant in 
the room huh? My kid tried ta off 'imself. We all fuckin' know it. That's 
it...nobody's got nothin' ta say...

Tony Soprano: They got 'im under observation, whatever the fuck that means. 
Stupid fuck! When did I lose this kid. What did I do wrong?
Paulie Walnuts: Whoah, come on.
Silvio Dante: Don't blame yourself T.
Bobby Baccilieri: Lot o' pressure on kids today Ton'.
Tony Soprano: Still, ta try ta kill 'imself.
Bobby Baccilieri: It happens skip.

Patsy Parisi: They're all different Ton'. My son Patrick, I love 'im ta death, 
but he can be a moody prick sometimes...

happy ta add to it.
Meadow Soprano: What?
Patrick Parisi: 'Scuse me.
Coco Cogliano: Lucky guy, her dad, must be fun tuckin' her in at night, huh?
Patrick Parisi: You have a problem?
Coco Cogliano: Not yet. Would you like one?

Vic.
%
Tony Soprano: And missin' sessions, unfortunately, is part o' my condition.
Dr. Jennifer Melfi: What do you know about your condition? You miss 
appointments because you don't give a shit, about commitments, about what I do, 
about the body of work that's gone into building up this science. Go ahead, 
tell me again I sound like your wife.
Tony Soprano: Well, if the shoe fits. (Melfi stands up) We're makin' progress. 
It's been seven years.
Dr. Jennifer Melfi: Do you want some names?
Tony Soprano: O...okay, (Tony stands up) I'm...I'm...listen I'm gonna tell you 
somethin', and you're not gonna like it but we can say anything in here-
Dr. Jennifer Melfi: Go ahead!
Tony Soprano: Alright...I'm...I'm chalkin' this all up to female menopausal 
situations.
Dr. Jennifer Melfi: You're not my gynecologist.
Tony Soprano: Well, you don't need a gynecologist to know which way the wind 
blows. (Melfi walks to her door and opens it) So wait a minute, you're tellin' 
me, after all this time, after everything we shared in here, you're cuttin' me 
loose just as my son got outta the hospital, for trying ta kill 'imself.
Dr. Jennifer Melfi: Since you are in crisis, I don't wanna waste your time.
Tony Soprano: You know, I gotta be fuckin' honest, as a doctor, I think what 
you're doin' is immoral.

Little Carmine Lupertazzi: It didn't have to be this way.
Butch DeConcini: We agreed. It's gone too far. Phil...I don't know, he's 
changed. You got my word. We'll back off.
Tony Soprano: My price is you help us get a location on Phil.
Butch DeConcini: I can't go there. But you do what you gotta do.
Tony Soprano: One more thing. You hit my brother in-law.
Butch DeConcini: So?
Tony Soprano: This is my sister we're talkin' about. She's gotta see somethin' 
outta this.
Butch DeConcini: We'll come up with a number? (Tony agrees and shakes hands 
with Butch)

Carmela Soprano: Okay, as your parents, we don't feel joining the army is in 
your best interest.
Anthony Junior: This country is in a crisis.
Carmela Soprano: How can one soldier stop it?
Anthony Junior: When my enlistment's up, I could join the CIA or something. And 
with a military background, I'd have a leg up. And as an Arabic speaker, I'd be 
really useful.
Tony Soprano: I don't understand. You're gonna ask the Donald for some time off 
from your pilot job to go on CIA missions?
Anthony Junior: Everything's a joke to you!
Tony Soprano: I'm not havin' a good time.
Anthony Junior: Did you, or did you not want me to go to military school!?

Paulie Walnuts: I beat cancer once, you got no idea what that does ta you!
Tony Soprano: Yeah, I know, I know, but Jesus, you got-
Paulie Walnuts: Richie Aprile, Ralphie M.I.A., Vito, and who knows what the 
fuck with Carlo and Gigi!
Tony Soprano: Gigi died takin' a shit!
Paulie Walnuts: Doesn't mean it's not part of an overall pat!
Tony Soprano: Paulie, you gonna deny yourself life change o' the money? A 
package to leave your neice who has MS? You know, it's like your bullshit with 
the cat. The fuckin' animal catches mice for us, but you drown it.
Paulie Walnuts: I would.
Tony Soprano: He's not lookin' at Christopher! A rat died in the wall back 
there or some shit.
Paulie Walnuts: I moved the picture, that fuckin' thing came to the new spot, 
and stared.
Tony Soprano: The abstract shapes or somethin'. Tell you this, since his death, 
my gamblin' looks done a one eighty.
Paulie Walnuts: Oh, okay. It's fine for you ta believe that, but I can't worry 
about a jinx? Ton', I never told this to another livin' soul...
Tony Soprano: Yeah?
Paulie Walnuts: One time at the Bing, I was alone ta meet Eddy Lind. I saw the 
Virgin Mary.
Tony Soprano: Why didn't you say somethin'? Fuck strippers, we coulda had a 
shrine. Sold holy water in gallon jugs. Coulda made billions!
Paulie Walnuts: I tell you somethin' deep in my heart, and you laugh it off?
Tony Soprano: I'm not sayin' there's nothin' out there Paulie, but to not live 
your life? What the fuck are you gonna do? Hey, you don't want the job, you 
don't want the job. I could put Patsy in there. He's gonna be part of my family 
now. Be good.

Uncle Junior: Fuck you want, a boutonniere?
Tony Soprano: Alright, listen to me, Uncle Pat came to see me about Janice, 
about your money.
Uncle Junior: People keep askin' me. I don't know. There's a man from another 
galaxy that came here.
Tony Soprano: That's your accountant.
Uncle Junior: I'm confused.
Tony Soprano: Any money should go to Bobby Bacala's kids, now Janice may not do 
that, but Bobby was with us. He was a made guy. Wouldn't be right.
Uncle Junior: Me, I never had kids.
Tony Soprano: You remember where your stash is, you let Uncle Pat know. Me, as 
the head o' the family, I'll hold onto it as a guardian, for Bobby's kids. You 
remember Bobby?
Uncle Junior: Sure.
Tony Soprano: You don't know who I am, do ya? Remember Johnny? Johnny Boy? Your 
kid brother? This thing of ours.
Uncle Junior: I was involved with that?
Tony Soprano: You and my dad. You two ran North Jersey.
Uncle Junior: We did?
Tony Soprano: Yeah.
Uncle Junior: Hmm. Well, that's nice. (Tony's eyes swell up with tears)
