Fry: Space. It seems to go on forever. But then you get to the end and the gorilla starts throwin' barrels at you.

Fry: Hello? Pizza delivery for uh... I.C. Wiener? Aww crud. I always thought by this point in my life I'd be the one making the prank calls.
%
Leela: I'm an alien, alright? Let's drop the subject.
Fry: Cool, an alien. Has your race taken over the planet?
Leela: No, I just work here.
%
[Fry's first glimpse of the future]
Fry: My God, it's the future. My parents, my co-workers, my girlfriend. I'll never see any of them again.
[Pause.]
Fry: YAHOO!!!
%
Fry: Can't you just leave me alone? I'm miserable enough already
Leela: I know it's not much consolation, but I know how you feel
Fry: No you don't. I've got no home, no family
Bender: No friends
%
Leela: This is Officer 1-B D-I requesting backup.
[The camera pulls back to reveal two police officers standing right next to her.]
Officer Smitty: We'll be there in 5 minutes.
%
Fry: Whoaâ€¦ a real live robot! Or is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume?
Bender: Bite my shiny metal ass.
Fry: It doesn't look so shiny to me.
Bender: Shinier than yours, meatbag.
%
Fry: Why would a robot need to drink?
Bender: I don't need to drink. I can quit anytime I want!
%
Leela: I'm sure this must be very upsetting for you.
Fry: Y'know, I guess it should be but, actually, I'm glad. I had nothing to live for in my old life. I was broke, I had a humiliating job and I was beginning to suspect my girlfriend might be cheating on me.
Leela: Well, at least here you'll be treated with dignity. Now strip naked and get on the probulator.
%
Fry: Are we going to fly all over space, fighting monsters and teaching alien women how to love?
Farnsworth: If by that you mean delivering cargo, then yes. It's a little home business I started to fund my research.
Fry: Cool. What's my job gonna be?
Farnsworth: You're gonna make sure the cargo reaches its destination.
Fry: So, I'm a delivery boy?
Farnsworth: Exactly.
Fry: All right! I'm a delivery boy!
%
Leela: Fry, we have a crate to deliver.
Fry: Well, let's just dump it in the sewer and say we delivered it.
Bender: Too much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer.
%
Amy: Leela's gonna kill me.
Bender: No, she'll probably make me do it.
%
Bender: I'm going to build my own theme park! With blackjack! And hookers! You know what- forget the park!
%
Bender: Oh, no room for Bender, eh? I'll build my OWN lunar landing... with blackjack, and hookers! In fact, forget the lunar lander and the blackjack! Ehh, screw the whole thing.
%
Craterface: Hi, I'm Craterface. Welcome to Luna Park. I'll have to confiscate your alcohol, sir.
Bender: Better mascots than you have tried. (takes a swig of booze and jams the bottle in Craterface's eye)
Craterface: At least I have my self-respect. (laughs, then sobs quietly)

Zoidberg: Now open your mouth and lets have a look at that brain.
[Fry opens his mouth]
Zoidberg: No, no, not that mouth.
Fry: I only have one.
Zoidberg: Really?
Fry: Uh... is there a human doctor around?
Zoidberg: Young lady, I am an expert on humans. Now pick a mouth, open it and say "brglgrglgrrr"!
Fry: Uh... brglgrglgrglgrrr!
Zoidberg: What? My mother was a saint! Get out!

[Fry and Leela are taking a ride on the Moon Park]
Moon Rover Ride Narrator: The story of lunar exploration started with one man - a man with a dream.
Animatronic Ralph Kramden: One of these days, Alice-- Bang, zoom, straight to the moon!
Leela: Wow! I never realized the first astronauts were so fat.
Fry: That's not an astronaut, it's a TV comedian! And he was just using space travel as a metaphor for beating his wife
%
Animatronic Whalers: [Singing] We're whalers on the moon,
We carry a harpoon.
But there ain't no whales,
So we tell tall-tales,
And sing our whaling tune.

Fry: Uh, greetings Moon Man, we come in peace. I am Fry from the planet Earth.
Sal: Wise guy, huh? If I wasn't so lazy I'd punch you in the stomach.
Fry: But, you are lazy right?
Sal: Oh, don't get me started!
%
Fry: Hey, I got everyone magnets. [puts one on Bender's head]
Bender: Get it off! Get it off! [singing] How many roads must a man walk down before you can call him a...
[Fry removes magnet]
Bender: Don't ever do that! Magnets interfere with my inhibition unit.
Fry: So you flip out and start acting like a crazy folk singer?
Bender: Yes. I guess a robot would have to be crazy to be a folk singer...
%
Bender: You know, Fry, out of all the friends I've ever had... you're the first.
%
[In their search for a new apartment, Fry, Bender and Leela check out a "suspiciously fantastic apartment"]
Fry: I don't get it. What's the catch?
Salesman: Oh, no catch. Although we are technically in New Jersey.
[cut to Fry, Bender and Leela at the Planet Express employee lounge]
Fry: Not one place even remotely liveable.
%
Bender: [in his sleep] Kill all humans, kill all humans, must kill all humans...
Fry: Bender, wake up!
Bender: Wh-uh? I was having the most wonderful dream. I think you were in it.
Fry: Where's the bathroom?
Bender: The bath what?
Fry: Bathroom.
Bender: The what room?
Fry: Bathroom!
Bender: The what what?
Fry: Never mind.
[Bender goes back to sleep.]
Bender: Hey, sexy mama, wanna kill all humans?
%
Farnsworth: (Talking on the phone) Did he at least die painlessly? To shreds, you say. How's his wife holding up? To shreds, You say.
%
Bender: Not enough room? My place is two cubic meters, and we only take up 1.5 cubic meters. We've got room for a whole 'nother two thirds of a person!
%
[Fry, Bender and Leela are checking out an appartment based on the "Relativity" print by M.C. Escher]
Leela: Wow, this is fantastic.
Fry: I don't know, I don't want to pay for an extra dimension we're not going to use.
%
Bender: This last week with Fry has been great. Beneath his warm, soft exterior beats the cold, mechanical heart of a robot.
%
Calculon: I've been processing this for quite sometime, Monique, will you marry me?
Monique: Oh, Calculon! Yes!
[Calculon fits the ring on Monique's finger]
Monique: It fits! Then you must know I'm...
Calculon: Metric? I've always known, but for you I'm willing to convert
%
Prof. Farnsworth: Oh, fuff! Fry's not causing any trouble. Now, if you don't mind, I'm rather busy. I seem to have mislaid my alien mummy. This sarcophagus should contain the remains of Emperor Nimballa, who ruled Zuban 5 over 29 million years ago.
[Fry walks past the lab eating the mummy.]
Fry: Hey, Professor, great jerky!
Farnsworth: My God, this is an outrage! I was going to eat that mummy!
%
Zapp Brannigan: Whatever it is, I'm willing to put wave after wave of men at your disposal. Right, men?
Unseen Man: You suck!
%
Zapp Brannigan: Kif, I have made it with a woman. Inform the men.
%
Leela: You know Zapp, once I thought you were a big pompous buffoon. Then I realized that inside, you were just a pitiful child. But now I realize that outside that child is a big pompous buffoon!
Zapp Brannigan: And which one rocked your world?
%
Leela: Look, last night was a mistake.
Zapp Brannigan: A sexy mistake.
Leela: No, just a regular mistake.
%
Zapp Brannigan: In the game of chess, you can never let your adversary see your pieces.
%
Zapp Brannigan: We have failed to uphold Brannigan's Law. However I did make it with a hot alien babe. And in the end, is that not what man has dreamt of since first he looked up at the stars?
[Short pause]
Zapp Brannigan: Kif, I'm asking you a question.
[Kif groans]
%
Zapp Brannigan: Brannigan's Law is like Brannigan's love: hard and fast.
%
Zapp Brannigan: So, crawling back to the Big Z like a bird on its belly. Delicious.
Leela: Birds don't crawl.
Zapp Brannigan: They've been known to!
%
Leela: Look, I'm going down to Vergon 6 to save those animals whether you like it or not.
Zapp Brannigan: Go ahead. I won't stop you.
Leela: Threaten all you-- Wait. What?
Zapp Brannigan: We both know you won't make it halfway to Vergon 6 before the craving sets in. Then you'll come crawling back for another taste of sweet, sweet candy... bam!
%
Zapp Brannigan: Welcome to my humble chamber, or as I call it, "the Lovenasium". Sham-pag-in?
Leela: I didn't realise you were such a coin-a-sewer.
Zapp Brannigan: Well, I have studied abroad...or two!
%
Zapp Brannigan: Captain's journal. Star date; 3000.3.
Kif: Who are you talking to, sir?
Zapp Brannigan: You! Aren't you getting this? We have detected a vessel attempting to break the security cordon around Vergon 6. I'm anticipating an all-out tactical dogfight, followed by a light dinner... ravioli, ham, sundae bar.
%
Farnsworth: It's a sunny little doomed planet, inhabited by a number of frisky little doomed animals.
Leela: Animals?
Farnsworth: That's right. Animals in desperate need of rescue. You see, Vergon 6 was once filled with a super-dense substance known as dark matter, each pound of which weighs over ten thousand pounds.
Leela: Wait! What about the animals?
Farnsworth: Well, dark matter is extremely valuable as starship fuel. That's why it was all mined out, leaving the planet completely hollow.
Leela: Yes, but what about the animals?
Farnsworth: The wha?
Leela: The animals.
Farnsworth: I didn't say anything about animals. Now it seems that the planet will collapse within three days. Incidentally, this will kill all the animals.
%
Robot #1: Administer the test.
Robot #2: Which of the following would you most prefer? A: a puppy, B: a pretty flower from your sweetie, or C: a large properly formatted data file?
Robot #1: Choose!
[Fry and Leela confer for a bit.]
Fry: Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way?
Robot #2: No, it is the bad kind of puppy.
Leela: Then we'll go with that data file!
Robot #2: Correct!
Robot #1: The flower would also have been acceptable.
%
Fry: Man, we look stupid. We should've gotten store-bought costumes.
Leela: Yeah, but there wasn't a Woolworth's in this quadrant.
%
Bender: Well I'm not doing it! It's a robot holiday.
Fry: Really? Which one?
Bender: Only Robannukah, the holiest two weeks on the robot calendar.
Leela: Oh, come on, Bender. Last month it was "Robomadom" and before that "Robonza".
Fry: Man, that one was a blast!
Bender: It wasn't just "a blast". It was a sacred tribute to my ancestral prototypes which happened to take the form of a drinking contest.
%
Farnsworth: He's good, alright. But he's no Clem Johnson. And Johnson played back in the days before steroid injections were mandatory.
%
Fry: I don't get this. Is Blernsball exactly the same as baseball?
Farnsworth: Baseball? God forbid.
Leela: Face it, Fry, baseball was as boring as mom and apple pie.
Fry: It wasn't bori- (cuts himself off) so they finally jazzed it up.

Robot Mayor: Welcome to a very special human hunt! We have with us today a guest whose irrational hatred for humans makes me look like a human sympathizer!
[The robots in the crowd laugh]
Robot Mayor: A newly-arrived refugee from Earth, let's hear it for... Bender!
Fry: It's him! He's OK!
Bender: Death to humans!
[The robots in the crowd cheer]
Fry: Aww... It's good to hear his voice.
%
Fry: We're rescuing ya.
Bender: I don't want to be rescued.
Fry: Say what?
Bender: I love this planet! I've got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those things bring.
%
Bender: Now Wireless Joe Jackson - there was a blern-hitting machine.
Leela: Exactly! He was a machine designed to hit blerns. Wireless Joe Jackson was nothing but a programmable bat on wheels.
Bender: Oh, and I suppose Pitch-o-Mat 5000 was just a modified howitzer!
Leela: Yep.

Voice on TV: Do you remember when chocolate-chip cookies came fresh out of the oven? Petridge Farm remembers
Fry: Oh, those were the days...
Voice on TV: Do you remember when women weren't allowed to vote and certain folk weren't allowed on golf courses? Petridge Farm remembers.

Prof. Farnsworth: I'm sorry, Fry, but anchovies went extinct in the 2200s.
Fry: Wha?
Prof. Farnsworth: Oh, my, yes. Fished out of existence... just about the time your people arrived on Earth, Dr. Zoidberg.
Zoidberg: I'm not on trial here.
Fry: So, none of you have ever had anchovies? Oh, man! You don't know what you're missing. They were salty and oily and melted in your mouth...
Zoidberg: Okay, okay! I admit it! My people ate them all! We kept saying one more couldn't hurt, and then they were gone! We're sorry!
%
Leela: You're Fry's relative. Do you have any idea how he got so crazy?
Prof. Farnsworth: Uh, what? Oh, yeah, they say madness runs in our family. Some even call me mad. And why? Because I dared to dream of my own race of atomic monsters, atomic supermen with octagonal shaped bodies that suck blood...
%
[Fry is serving pizza with anchovies]
Fry: Okay, my friends, get ready for the most delicious extinct animal you've ever tasted.
Amy: I don't know, I've had cow.
%
Leela: I don't get it, Fry. Who was Ted Danson, and why did you bid $10, 000 for his skeleton?
Fry: I have an idea for a sitcom.
%
Zoidberg: That stench. That heavenly stench! [Eats all the anchovies] More...More...
Fry: There aren't any more, and there never will be.
Zoidberg: [advances menacingly] More...More! More! MORE!!!

[Bender is watching a cooking show called Essence of Elzar]
Fry: Hey, whatcha watching?
Leela: Is that a cooking show?
Bender: [turns off the TV] No, of course not. It was... uh... porno. Yeah, that's it.
Leela: [turns the TV back on] Bender, I didn't know you liked cooking. That's so cute.
Bender: Aww, it's true. I've been hiding it for so long.
Fry: It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too.
Bender: [sotto voce] Pansy.
%
Leela: Look at all these guys. Do you have any idea what the average length of their reigns was?
Fry: Uhh...... 80,000 years?
Leela: No, one week!
Fry: Damn! I knew you wouldn't have asked unless it was really high or really low.
%
Fry: It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you?
%
Fry: That was the saltiest thing I ever tasted! And I once ate a big heaping bowl of salt!
%
Bender: There was nothing wrong with that food. The salt level was 10% less than a lethal dose.
Zoidberg: Uh-oh! I shouldn't have had seconds.
%
Fry: It's no use. I want to cry, but I'm just too macho.
Bender: I'll make you cry, buddy. You're a pimple on society's ass and you'll never amount to anything!
Fry: Wha'd'you mean? I was emperor of a whole planet.
Bender: Good point... but here's a disturbing reminder: anyone you knew or loved in the 20th century is dead.
Fry: These things happen.
Bender: Okay, Fry, grab a Kleenex for this one, 'cause there's no god and your idiotic human ideals are laughable. Ha ha ha!
Fry: Phew, that's a load off my mind.
%
Fry: Now that you mention it, I do have trouble breathing underwater sometimes. I'll take the gills.
Organ Salesman: Yes, gills. Then, uh, you don't need lungs anymore, is right?
Fry: Can't imagine why I would.
Organ Salesman: Lie down on table. I take lungs now, gills come next week.
%
Leela: I know you like cooking shows, but you're a robot. You don't even have a sense of taste.
Bender: Honey, I wouldn't talk about taste if I was wearing a lime green tank top.

Hermes: Bender, it has come to my attention that this company has been paying you to do nothing but loaf around on the couch.
Bender: You call that a couch? I demand a pillow!

Murg: This is Your Majesty's harem. You may choose any of these maidens to be your royal consort.
Fry: Puh, puh, puh... How about that one?
Murg: Oh, I didn't realize Your Majesty was into that sort of thing.
Fry: On second thought, I'll take that one.
Murg: Hey, whatever you say. I'm not here to pass judgement.
%
Prof. Farnsworth: Good news, everyone!
Bender: Uh-oh, I don't like the sound of that.
Prof. Farnsworth: You'll be making a delivery to the planet Trisol. A mysterious world in the darkest depths of the Forbidden Zone.
Bender: Thank you and goodnight.
Leela: Uh, Professor, are we even allowed in the Forbidden Zone?
Prof. Farnsworth: Why, of course! It's just a name! Like the Death Zone or the Zone of No Return. All the zones have names like that in the Galaxy of Terror!
%
Fry: [After testing the Smell-o-Scope] Just don't make me smell Uranus! [Laughs]
Leela: I don't get it.
Professor Farnsworth: I'm sorry, Fry, but astronomers renamed Uranus in 2620 to end that stupid joke once and for all.
Fry: So what's it called now?
Professor Farnsworth: Urrectum. Here, let me locate it for you.
%
Bart Simpson-doll: Eat my shorts!
Bender: Okay! [Eats the doll's shorts.] Mmm, shorts.
%
Fry: Hey, you have no right to criticize the 20th century. We gave the world the light bulb, the steam boat and the cotton gin.
Leela: Those things are all from the 19th century.
Fry: Yeah, well, they probably just copied us.
%
Wernstrom: And what will you be presenting this evening, professor?
Farnsworth: Let's just say it'll put you young whippersnappers in your place.
Wernstrom: I just hope it's not that lame death clock you presented last year.
Farnsworth: Uh... last year, you say?
Wernstrom: That's right.
Farnsworth: Oh, my. Did it put you young whippersnappers in your place?
Wernstrom: Hardly. We all laughed so hard our teeth fell out. Come along, Cinnamon.
[Wernstrom leaves with his fish]
Farnsworth: Oh, dear. I'll have to invent something new in the next ten minutes. Perhaps some sort of death clock.

Professor Farnsworth: I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe!
Bender: Ooh, name it after me!
%
[The Planet Express crew has watched an online movie about the solution to the garbage problem in New York.]
Fry: Wow, you got that off the Internet? In my day, the Internet was only used to download pornography.
Professor Farnsworth: Actually, that's still true.
[In the movie.]
Female Scientist: Now that the garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions?
Male Scientist: With gusto. [The two scientists begin disrobing.]
%
[Fry, Leela, and Bender are on the big garbage ball. Leela places the bomb in the ground.]
Leela: Get ready to run. We got 25 minutes.
[Leela presses the button on the bomb. The timer beeps and the number changes]
Leela: Uh, 15 minutes. [The timer beeps again.] 5 minutes. [The timer beeps again.] "6h" minutes?
[Bender picks up the bomb and turns it upside down]:
Bender: There's your problem: the professor put the counter on upside down!
Leela: That idiot! It wasn't set for 25 minutes; it was set for 52 seconds!
Fry: [screams] AHHHH! We're gonna die!...Right?
Bender: Right.
[Fry screams again]
%
[After escaping Robot Hell]
Bender: Don't worry, guys. I'll never be too good or too evil again. From now on, I'll just be me.
Leela: Uh... Do you think you could be a little less evil than that?
Bender: I don't know... Do you think you could survive a seven-hundred foot fall?
Fry: [Chuckles] Good ol' Bender.
%
Leela: Bender, why are you spending so much time in the bathroom? Are you jacking on in there?
Bender: [Nervous] No! Don't come in!
%
Leela: Bender, we didn't mind your drinking, or your kleptomania, or your pornography ring.
Zoidberg: In fact, that's why we loved you.
Leela: But this electricity abuse crossed the line. You almost killed us.
Fry: And you made me feel like a jerk for trusting you. Just like when my friend Richie swore he wasn't taking drugs, and then he sold me my mom's VCR, and then, later, I found out he was taking drugs. You make me ashamed to be your friend.
%
Robot Devil: We know all your sins, Bender! And for each one we've prepared an agonizing and ironic punishment! Gentlemen...

Bender: Ah, crap. Singing... Mind if I smoke?
Robot Devil: [Singing] Cigars are evil, you won't miss 'em,
We'll find ways to simulate that smell.
What a sorry fella, rolled up and smoked like a donnetela,
Here on Level One of Robot Hell.

Gambling's wrong and so is cheating, so is forging phoney IOU's
Let's let Lady Luck decide what type of torture's justified,
I'm pit boss here on Level Two.
Ooo, deep-fried robot!
Bender: Just tell me why...
Robot Devil: Check out this 55-page warrant.
Bender: There must be robots worse than I...
Robot Devil: We've checked it out; there really aren't!
Bender: Then please let me explain,
My crimes were merely boy-ish pranks...
Robot Devil: You stole from boy scouts, nuns, and banks!
Bender: Ah, don't blame me; blame my upbringing! [Tries to take the Robot Devil's wallet]
Robot Devil: Please stop sinning while I'm singing!

Selling bootleg tapes is wrong,
Musicians need that income to survive
Beastie Boys: Hey, Bender, gonna make some noise,
With your hard drive scratched by the Beastie Boys!

That's whatcha, whatcha, whatcha get on Level Five!
%
Fry:[On the slide] I don't feel well...
Leela:[On the slide] It's up to us to rescue him.
Fry: Maybe he likes it here in Hell...
Leela: It's us who tempted him to sin.
Fry: Maybe he's back at the motel...
Leela: Come on, Fry, don't be scared,
I'm sure at least one of us will be spared,
So just sit back and enjoy the ride.
Fry: My ass has blisters from the slide!
%
Robot Devil: Fencing diamonds,
Fixing cockfights, publishing indecent magazines,
You'll pay for every crime, knee-deep in electric slime,
You'll suffer till the end of time,
Enduring tortures, most of which rhyme,
Trapped forever here in Robot Hell!!!

Fry: Bender, are you alright?
Bender: No! Oh, they tortured me with up-tempo singing and dancing!

Prof. Farnsworth: Good news, everyone! Today you'll be delivering a crate of subpoenas to Sicily 8, the Mob Planet.

Fry: I know Big Vinny said he was giving me the Kiss of Death, but I still think he's gay.
Leela: Did he use his tongue?
Fry: A little.

[at a Beastie Boys concert]
Leela: They're laying down mad rhymes with an 80% success rate.
Bender: I believe that qualifies as ill, at least from a technical standpoint.

Hermes: Our electrical bill is climbing higher than a green snake up a sugar cane. Obviously someone here has been using a whole heap of juice. Probably you!
Zoidberg: Me?
[Later]
Hermes: And as a further cost-cutting measure, I have eliminated the salt water cooler.
Zoidberg: This is a witch hunt!
%
Bender: In the name of all that is good and logical, we give thanks for the chemical energy we are about to absorb. To quote the prophet Jerematic, one-zero-zero-zero-one-zero-one-zero-one-zero-one-zero-one... [later] ... zero-one-zero-one-one-zero-zero-one... two. Amen.

Kif: Sir, can I speak with you?
Zapp Brannigan: No!
Kif: But, sir, it's an emergency.
Zapp Brannigan: Come back when it's a catastrophe.
[The ship shakes and rumbles]
Zapp Brannigan: [stands up] Oh, very well.

Leela: That was the worst delivery ever.
Fry: Yeah, I'm never going to another planet called Cannibalon.
Bender: Me neither! Food was good, though.
%
Zapp Brannigan: Kif, I'm feeling the "Captain's itch".
Kif: I'll get the powder, sir.
%
Bender: You all go without me! I'm gonna take one last look around, you know, for, uh, stuff to steal!
Fry: You're going back for the Countess, aren't you?
Bender: All right, I am. But I don't want the others to know. If I don't come back, just say I died robbing some old man.
Fry: I'll tell them you went down prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger.
Bender: [hugging Fry] I love you, buddy!
%
Countess de LaRoca: Bender, you risked your life to save me!
Bender: And I'd do it again! And perhaps a third time! But that would be it.

Kif: Sir, remember your course correction?
Zapp Brannigan: No.
Kif: Well, it's proving somewhat more suicidal than we had initially hoped.
%
Bender: Wait, my cheating unit malfunctioned. You gotta' give me a do-over.
Craps dealer: Sorry, the house limit is three do-overs.
%
Zapp Brannigan: But as a gentleman, I must warn you, if you so much as glance at another woman, I'll be on Leela like a fly on a pile of very seductive manure.
%
Prof. Farnsworth: Thank God there's plenty of escape pods. We won't have to dress up like women and children.

Leela: Oh, God, not Zapp Brannigan.
Dr. Zoidberg: You know Zapp Brannigan?
Leela: Let's just say we've crossed paths.
Bender: Was that before or after you slept with him?
%
Zapp Brannigan: Don't blame yourself, Kif. We were doomed from the start. I guess all that remains now is for the captain to go down with the ship.
Kif: That's surprisingly noble of you, sir.
Zapp Brannigan: No, it's noble of you, Kif. As of now, you're in command. Congratulations, Captain.

Fry: You're not jealous, are you?
Leela: No!
Fry: Good, 'cause I consider my fake relationship with you a lot more meaningful.

Fry: Oh. Look, I'm not actually interested in her, if that's what's bothering you.
Leela: Oh, are you sure? I mean, she has two eyes, you have two eyes...?
Fry: I know. We seem like a perfect match. But, I just don't feel that way about her.
%
Leela: Well, accommodations aren't great, but it sure is beautiful out here
Fry: Yeah, it's pretty romantic- I mean, platonic, that sure is one platonic view.
Leela: Fry, just be quiet, I'm starting to think this whole fake fiance thing was a terrible, terrible [gasps]
[Leela surprises Fry with a big kiss in front of Zapp. After Zapp leaves, Leela breaks the kiss]
Leela: Uh, look... Before you get any crazy ideas, that was for Zapp.
Fry: Well, you got anything else for him?
%
Kif: This is a pleasure cruise. Our path is decided by the travel agency.
Zapp Brannigan: That's for schoolgirls. Now here's a course with some chest hair. [Draws a meandering line on the chart]
Kif: But that leads us straight through a swarm of comets.
Zapp Brannigan: Ah, yes. Comets, the icebergs of the sky.
%
Professor Farnsworth: Oh, I always feared he might run off like this. Why, why, why didn't I break his legs?
%
Leela: What you did to Guenter was cruel. At the risk of sounding like an after-school special, I think we learned who the real animal was today.
Fry: You mean peer pressure?
%
Fry: This is awesome! I had no idea that Mars had a university
Professor Farnsworth: Well, back in those days, Mars was a dreary, uninhabitable wasteland. Much like Utah.
%
[While searching the jungle for Guenter]
Fry: Wow, the jungles on Mars look exactly like the jungles on Earth!
Professor Farnsworth: Jungles on Earth? [Laughs]
%
Guenter: All I want is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit... that's why I'm transferring to business school!
Professor Farnsworth: NOOOOOO!
%
Dean Vernon: You robots are a disgrace to this university! Whenever a fire alarm is pulled, Robot House! Whenever the campus liquor store is looted, Robot House! Whenever a human corpse is desecrated...
Bender: Now I can explain that!
%
Dean Vernon: [repeated line] Robot House!!
%
Leela: So you're saying that he just ran off in the middle of the exam?
Prof. Farnsworth: All he handed in was a paper smeared with feces. He tied with Fry.
%
Leela: You went to college?
Bender: Of course. I'm a bender. I went to Bending College; I majored in Bending.
Fry: What was your minor?
Bender: Robo-American Studies.
%
Prof. Farnsworth: It's a little experiment that might win me the Nobel Prize.
Leela: In what field?
Prof. Farnsworth: I don't care; they all pay the same.
%
Fry: Hey, professor. What are you teaching this semester?
Prof. Farnsworth: Same thing I teach every semester: The Mathematics of Quantum Neutrino Fields. I made up the title so that no student would dare take it.
Fry:[writing] Mathematics of wonton burrito meals. I'll be there!
Prof. Farnsworth: Please, Fry. I don't know how to teach. I'm a professor.
%
Zapp Brannigan: The key to victory is discipline, and that means a well made bed. You will practice until you can make your bed in your sleep.
Fry: You mean while I'm sleeping in it?
Zapp Brannigan: You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you'll be doing.
%
Beach Bully: Huh, err, sir, you don't understand. I'm a professional beach bully. I pretend to steal your girl, you punch me, I go down, she swoons, you slip me 50 bucks.
Fry: 50 bucks? Not even if she was my girlfriend. You take her!
%
Zapp Brannigan: The alien mother-ship is in orbit here. If we can hit that bulls-eye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate.
%
Zapp Brannigan: [having just seen another massive spaceship appear] What the hell is that thing?!
Kif Kroker: It appears to be the mother ship.
Zapp Brannigan: Then what did we just blow up?
[Kif checks the star chart]
Kif Kroker: The Hubble Telescope.
%
[The real alien mothership appears and it starts easily destroying the ships]
Zapp Brannigan: Stop exploding, you cowards!
%
Zapp Brannigan: When I'm in command, every mission is a suicide mission.
%
Hermes: What in the name of Bob Marley's ghost? Get to work, you lazy boat bag!
[He rolls up the paper and hits Bender with it. Fry chuckles. Hermes hits him.]
Fry: Hey, quit it, Hermes. It's Labor Day.
Hermes: Labor Day? That phoney-baloney holiday crammed down our throats by fat-cat union gangsters?
Fry: That's the one.
Hermes: Hot damn, a day off!
%
Zapp Brannigan: Our mission is clear: Destroy all alien lifeforms.
Kif Kroker: Um...not me, sir.
Zapp Brannigan: Right. Nobody destroy Kif. Unless you have too.
%
Fry: OK, Leela, you'll be starring as Jenny--
Leela: Uh-uh, forget it. A, I'm camera shy; and B, I get tongue tied in front of an audience armed with death rays.
Amy: Plus, you don't really have the thighs for a miniskirt.
Leela: Gimme the script
%
Lrrr: Surely you know McNeal. She is an unmarried human female struggling to succeed in a human male's world.
Zapp Brannigan: Maybe that's just her excuse for being incompetent.
%
Amy: There. How do I look?
Farnsworth: Like a cheap French harlot.
Amy: French?
%
Bender: They must just wanna see that episode. Let's find a tape and give it to 'em.
Amy: There aren't any copies left.
Farnsworth: No, there wouldn't be. Most videotapes from that era were damaged in 2443 during the Second Coming of Jesus.
%
Lrrr: Attention McNeil. We are reasonably satisfied with the events we have seen. Overall I would rate it a C+. Okay, not great. As a result we will not destroy your planet. But neither will we provide you with our recipe for immortality!
Fry: Way to overact, Zoidberg!
%
[Bender feels sick]
Amy Wong: You should try homeopathic medicine, Bender. Try some zinc.
Bender: I'm 40% zinc!
Amy Wong: Then take some echinacea, or St. John's Wort.
Professor Farnsworth: Or a big fat placebo. It's all the same crap!
%
[Bender sees the insides of a transsexual female robot]
Bender:[gasps] That's no lady!
Trans-bot: Damn, Chico. One more upgrade and I'll be more lady than you can handle. Why do have to be so stupid, Stupid?
Bender: Hey bite my shiny metal ass!
Trans-bot: You couldn't afford it, honey. [snaps fingers and walks away]
%
Slurm Queen: As for you, you will be submerged in Royal Slurm which, in a matter of minutes, will transform you into a Slurm Queen like myself!
Small Glurmo #1: But, Your Highness, she's a commoner. Her Slurm will taste foul.
Slurm Queen: Yes! Which is why we'll market it as New Slurm. Then, when everyone hates it, we'll bring back Slurm Classic, and make billions!
%
Bender: What should we try it on first?
Fry: Try it on me [Bender points the F-Ray at Fry's body] ow, my sperm!
Bender: I'll try it again [He does so]
Fry: Huh. Didn't hurt that time
%
Fry: All this prolonged exposure to radiation is making me thirsty
%
Professor Farnsworth: Who are those horrible orange creatures over there?
Glurmo: Why those are the Grunka-Lunkas. They work here in the Slurm factory.
Professor Farnsworth: Tell them I hate them.
%
Glurmo: There will be no further questions!
Fry: [Raises his hand] Why?
%
Glurmo: You'll have all the Slurm you can drink when you're partying with Slurms McKenzie!
Fry: When will that be?
Glurmo: Soon enough.
Fry: That's not soon enough!
%
Grunka-Lunka song:
Grunka-Lunkas: Grunka-Lunka dunkety doo
We've got a friendly warning for you
Grunka-Lunka dunkety dasis
The secret of Slurm's on a need-to-know basis
Asking questions in school is a great way to learn
If you try that stuff here you might get your legs broke
We once found a dead guy face down in the Slurm
It could easily happen again to you, folks
So keep your head down and keep your mouth shut
Grunka Lunka Lunka dunkety dutt!
%
Leela: What's behind that door? Is it the secret ingredient?
Grunka-Lunkas: [singing] Grunka-Lunka dunkety dingredient
You should not ask about the secret ingredient!
Bender: [Angrily] Okay, okay, we get the point!!
Leela: I was just curious because of the armed guards.
Grunka-Lunkas: [singing] Grunka-Lunka dunkety darmed-guards...
Bender: SHUT THE HELL UP!!!
%
Professor Farnsworth: And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet, Nibbler, who's gone to a place where I, too, hope one day to go. The toilet.
%
Bender: You guys realize you live in a sewer, right?
Dwayne: Perhaps, but perhaps your civilization is merely the sewer of an even greater society above you!
Leela: No. We're on the top.
Fry: Daylight and everything.
Vyolet: It must be wonderful.
Bender: Meh.
%
Calculon: Give it to me straight, doctor. Don't sugar-coat it.
DoctorBot: All right. Your entire family died when a plane piloted by your fiance crashed into your uninsured home, and you have inoperable cancer.
Bender: [laughs hysterically] Bet you didn't expect that one, Calculon!
%
Leela: Are you alright?
Bender: Ah, it's nothing a lawsuit won't cure.
Leela: Not you. [She picks up Nibbler and looks in his mouth.] Aww, poor baby chipped a fang.
[She carries Nibbler away and kisses and pets him.]
Bender: Hey, I got a busted ass here, I don't see anyone kissing it!
Zoidberg: Alright, I'm coming.
%
Leela: Bender, I thought you were supposed to be cooking for this party.
Bender: Fine, we'll have rack of Nibbler!
Leela: Just make a simple cake, and this time if someone's going to jump out of it, make sure you put them in after you cook it.
%
Zapp Brannigan: Throw her in the brig.
Fry: We don't have a brig.
Zapp Brannigan: Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as "the brig".
[Later]
Kif: What shall I do with your civilian clothes?
Zapp Brannigan: Take them to the laundry/brig!
%
Glab: I can think of no better place for this centre of diplomacy than here in orbit around the Neutral Planet. What are your thoughts on this momentous occasion, Your Neutralness?
Neutral President: I have no strong feelings one way or the other.
%
Zapp Brannigan: It was almost the perfect crime, but you forgot one thing: Rock crushes scissors ... but paper covers rock ... and scissors cut paper. Kif, we have a conundrum. Search them for paper, and bring me a rock.
%
Zapp Brannigan: My friends, you can take away a man's title and his uniform but you can never take away his integrity or his honour. Plus it was mostly Kif's fault.
Kif Kroker: What?
Glab: Kif Kroker, you are also stripped of your rank and dishonourably discharged
%
Zapp Brannigan: This is Zapp Brannigan of the good ship ... Planet Express Ship. I come swinging the olive branch of peace.
Neutral President's Aide: Should we trust him, Your Neutralness?
Neutral President: All I know is my gut says maybe.
%
Neutral President's Aide: Your Neutralness, it's a beige alert.
Neutral President: If I don't survive, tell my wife, "Hello".
%
Zapp Brannigan: Oh Leela! You're the only person I could turn to; you're the only person who ever loved me.
Leela: I never loved you.
Zapp Brannigan: I meant physically. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food? I could clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you sexually?
Leela: You don't know how to do any of those things.
Zapp Brannigan: Kif might!
%
Bender: Ah, yes! John Quincy Adding Machine. He struck a chord with the voters when he pledged not to go on a killing spree.
Prof. Farnsworth: But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver.
%
Richard Nixon's Head: Look here, you drugged-out communist! I paid for this body, and I'd no sooner return it than my Cocker-Spaniel dog, Checkers.
Checker's Head: Arf!
Richard Nixon's Head: SHUT UP, DAMMIT!!!
%
Morbo: Morbo will now introduce tonight's candidates... Puny human no. 1, puny human no. 2, and Morbo's good friend, Richard Nixon.
Richard Nixon's Head: Hello Morbo, how's the family?
Morbo: Belligerent and numerous.
Richard Nixon's Head: Good man. Nixon's pro-war and pro-family.
%
Richard Nixon's Head: Nixon with charisma? My god, I could rule the universe!
%
Richard Nixon's Head: NIXON'S BACK!!
%
Morbo: All hail our gargantuan, cyborg president. May death come quickly to his enemies.
%
Bender: Game's over, losers! I have all the money!! Compare your lives to mine and then kill yourselves!
%
Prof Farnsworth: The problem with both parties is they always want to give your tax dollars to the less fortunate.
Fry: The less fortunate get all the breaks!
%
Fry: You look different. Did you get a haircut?
Bender: No! I sold my body.
Prof. Farnsworth: Sold your body? Oh, Bender, I've been down that road. I know it's glamorous and the parties are great, but you'll end up spending every dollar you make on jewelry and skintight pants.
%
Jack Johnson: It's time for someone who has the courage to stand up and say, I'm against those things that everybody hates!
John Jackson: Now, I respect my opponent. I think he's a good man. But quite frankly... I agree with everything he just said!
%
Narrator: You're entering the vicinity of an area adjacent to a location. The kind of place where there might be a monster or some kind of weird mirror. These are just examples. It could also be something much better. Prepare to enter The Scary Door. As per your request, please find enclosed the last man on earth.
[The man is in a library amongst the bookshelves]
Man: Finally, solitude. I can read books for all eternity. [His glasses break.] It's not fair! It's not fair! Wait, my eyes aren't that bad. I can still read the large print books. [His eyes fall out] It's not f-- Well, lucky I know how to read Braille. [His hands fall off and he screams. Then his tongue falls out and finally his head comes off.] Hey, look at that weird mirror!
%
Leela: There's a political debate on! Quick, change the channel!
Bender: Hey, that's what Fry said when we turned on the debate.
%
Zoidberg: You, a bobsledder? That I'd like to see!
Hermes: Listen, you filthy crab! 1,000 years ago, there was a legendary team of Jamaican bobsleders.
Fry: Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages.
Hermes: A true inspiration for the children.
%
Professor Farnsworth: Dear God, they'll be killed on our doorstep! And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd.
%
Fry: Every Christmas my Mom would get a fresh goose, for gooseburgers, and my Dad would whip up his special eggnog out of bourbon and ice cubes.
%
Bender: Lets face it, comedy's a dead art form. Now tragedy! Ha ha ha, that's funny.
%
Fry: This snow is beautiful. I'm glad global warming never happened.
Leela: Actually, it did. But thank God nuclear winter canceled it out.
%
Fry: I feel like a rat. Here I am whining like a pig while all along Leela is as lonely as a frog.
%
Man: Excuse me, sir, you're snowboarding off the trail.
Bender: Lick my frozen metal ass!
%
Fry: Please let us live. We'll put out milk and cookies for you.
Robot Santa: You dare bribe Santa? I'm going to shove coal so far up your stocking you'll be coughing up diamonds.
%
Leela: Fry's outside? He's in great danger!
Dr. Zoidberg: Why?
Leela: I'm telling you why! Because Santa Claus is coming to town!
%
[the Planet Express crew are relaxing at the ski lodge]
Fry: It really puts you in the Christmas mood.
Prof. Farnsworth: What-mas?
Fry: Christmas! You know, X-M-A-S.
Leela: Oh, you mean "Xmas"! You must be using an archaic pronunciation, like when you say "ask" instead of "axe".
%
Santa Claus Robot: You have all been very naughty! Very naughty indeed! Except you, Dr. Zoidberg. This is for you.
Dr. Zoidberg: A pogo stick!
%
Prof. Farnsworth: [spoken] Now let's all of us shut up and sing!
Amy: [singing] He knows when you are sleeping,
Prof. Farnsworth: [singing] He knows when you're on the can,
Leela: [singing] He'll hunt you down and blast your ass from here to Pakistan.
Dr. Zoidberg: [singing] Oh,
Hermes: [singing] You'd better not breathe, you'd better not move,
Bender: [singing] You're better off dead, I'm telling you, dude.
Fry: [singing] Santa Claus is gunning you down!
[Everyone cheers. Farnsworth takes off his lab coat, exposing himself again.]
Prof. Farnsworth: Merry Xmas, everyone!
%
Fry: Girls like swarms of lizards, right?
%
Dr. Zoidberg: Now Fry, it's been a few years since medical school, so remind me. Disemboweling in your species: fatal or non-fatal?
Fry: Fatal.
Dr. Zoidberg: [To Bender] Large bet on myself in round one.
%
Decapodian: See you at the frenzy, Doctor [He makes a gibberish noise].
Fry: Is that how you say "Zoidberg"? [The Decapodian runs off crying]
Zoidberg: [angrily] You didn't have to call attention to his speech impediment.
%
[Dr. Zoidberg is attempting to woo Edna, with help from Fry.]
Fry: Tell her you just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating.
Dr. Zoidberg: [to Edna] I just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. [to Fry] Fry, that doesn't make sense.
Edna: Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But okay.
Fry: Tell her she looks thin.
Dr. Zoidberg: You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from intestinal parasites?
Edna: Why yes! Thanks for noticing.
Dr. Zoidberg: [to Fry] Now what?
Fry: Ask her how her day was.
Dr. Zoidberg: Why would I want to know that?
Fry: You wouldn't. Ask anyway!
%
Fry: My fellow fish monsters, far be it for me to question your stupid civilization or its dumb customs, but is squeezing each other's brains out with a giant nutcracker really going to solve anything? Dr. Zoidberg is my friend, and though a woman has come between us, I say we'll always remain friends. You know why? For one reason...
[Dr. Zoidberg cuts off Fry's arm]
Fry: YOU BASTARD! I'LL KILL YOU! YOU BASTARD!
%
[after the "Frenzy" has finished]
Dr. Zoidberg: Now how am I going to get rid of my male jelly?
Fry: I'll lend you this. [Waves severed arm]
%
Prof. Farnsworth: We - by which I mean you - will have to rush him to his ancient home world, which will soon erupt in an orgy of invertebrate sex.
Fry: Oh, baby! I'm THERE!
Leela: Fry, do you even understand the word "invertebrate"?
Fry: Nope, but that's not the word I'm interested in. No need to pack pants, people! Let's roll!
%
Leela: Look at you guys. No offence, Fry, but you've become a fat sack of crap.
Fry: "Sack"?
Amy: And Bender, your beer belly is so big your door won't even close. And that doesn't even make sense.
%
[Zoidberg is unsuccessful in attracting a mate]
Leela: Why is Zoidberg the only one still alone?
Bender: Because he's a loser, that's why. He's the lobster equivalent of Fry.
Fry: Hey, I can any girl I want anytime I want! I'm just too busy.
[He plays with a yo-yo and the string gets tangled. He snarls and starts to untie it.]
%
Fry: Co-ed steam rooms! I love the future!
Leela: Uh, Fry, you're in the women's steam room.
Fry: Ah, futuristic!
Amy: [To Leela] Psst, look what life was like before genetic engineering.
Leela: Those poor 20th century women.
[Fry crosses his legs, embarrassed.]

Voice on T.V.: Is today's hectic lifestyle making you tense and impatient?
Bender: Shut up and get to the point!
%
Fry: Bender?! You stole the atom?
Bender: I can explain: It's very valuable.
%
Fry: My girlfriend had one of those. Actually it wasn't hers, it was her dad's. And she wasn't my girlfriend, she just lived next door and never closed her curtains.
Leela: Fry, remember what we said about ending your stories a sentence earlier?
%
[Fry, Leela, and Bender are riding in the car with Fry behind the wheel. The car suddnenly crashes and the airbags go off.]
Bender: Uhg...I think I got whiplash.
Leela: You can't have whiplash. You don't even have a neck.
Bender: I meant Ass-whiplash.
Fry: I'm just glad we hit something, I thought we'd never stop.
[Everyone gets out of the car, and are shocked to see a robot that looks like Bender]
Flexo: Ugh...I think I got whiplash. [faints]
%
Fry: How's that robot I ran over?
Farnsworth: We did all we could...
Fry: You mean he's...?
Farnsworth: Good as new? Yes!
%
Leela: Space bandidos have been operating in this quadrant so you'll each take 8-hour shifts guarding the safe. First Bender, then Flexo, then Fry.
Fry: Wait, hold on. I don't like the sound of that. Let's just go alphabetically.
Leela: OK. First Bender, then Flexo, then Fry.
Fry: Wait, let's go by rank.
Leela: OK. First Bender, then Flexo, then Fry.
Fry: Flexo outranks me?
Flexo: That's "Flexo outranks me, sir"!
%
Leela: Fry, why are you looking for Flexo in my underpants drawer?
Fry: I didn't find him ten minutes ago, so I thought it was time to check again.
%
Farnsworth: Good news, everyone. Report to my bedroom for a private exhibition.
[Everyone exchanges worried glances with one another. In his bedroom, Farnsworth sits on his four-post bed and the staff and Flexo gather around]
Farnsworth: Everyone get in bed with me. I have something to show you
[Everyone climbs on and Farnsworth presses a button and makes the curtains around the bed close. What goes on inside is hidden from view.]
Farnsworth: Feast your eyes on this!
[Everyone gasps.]
Leela: It's beautiful!
Amy: And huge!
Fry: Can I touch it?
%
Fry: Hey, tell me something. You've got all this money. How come you always dress like you're doing your laundry?
Amy: I guess because my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. As though!
Fry: I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the pope?
Amy: Yeah, and if you were the pope they'd be all, "Straighten your pope hat." And "Put on your good vestments."
%
Bender: She is well traveled... and I don't mean she travels a lot.
%
Fry: Sorry, I'm not here to buy.
Car Dealer: I understand. But it's wonderful that you don't care whether anyone questions your sexual orientation.
Fry: I care! I care plenty! But I just don't know how to make them stop!
Car Dealer: One word: Thundercougarfalconbird.
%
Bender: Congratulations, Fry! You snagged the perfect girlfriend. Amy's rich, she probably has got other characteristics...
Leela: Bender! Romance isn't about money.
Bender: Oh, so it's just coincidence that Zoidberg is desperately poor and miserably lonely? Please!
%
(Zoidberg raises one of his mouth mandibles to protest)
Leela: For your information, it's because he's hideous.
%
(Zoidberg drops his mouth mandible and slumps sadly)
Prof. Farnsworth: I still don't understand why you wouldn't let me graft a laser cannon on your chest, to crush those who disobey you! But I guess we're just two different people.
%
Bender: Everything worked out great thanks to good old Bender.
Leela: Come on! It's not like you intentionally set us up with bad dates so we'd spend Valentine's Day together.
Bender: Didn't I, Leela? Didn't I?
Leela: No, you didn't! You just corralled a bunch of stiffs at the bus station and pocketed our money!
Bender: True. But, in the end, isn't that what Valentine's Day is really all about?
Leela: Yeah.
Fry: I guess so.
%
Amy: Hey, let's go car shopping! My parents promised if I got all B's they'd buy me a bar, and I got all C's!

Zapp Brannigan: Baby, wait! You didn't show me your surprise.

Bender: Wait. You mean people will pay good money for romance? Hmm. I think I have a scheme so deviously clever that I -

Judge: $500 and time served.
Bender: [with a gold tooth] Stupid anti-pimping laws. Well, pay the man!
Fembot: Bender, honey, we love you.
Bender: Shut up, baby, I know it!
%
Amy: OK, Fry, we're done putting on the bra.
Fry: Why exactly did you shave your legs anyway? Are you expecting something to happen with your Valentine's date?
Amy: What business is it of yours?
Fry: And another thing: You're using an awful lot of make-up there.
Amy: This is deodorant.
Fry: What does it do?
%
Fry: Hey, I can get a date too. Now that I'm single, I'll attract all sorts of women!
Amy: With my body I think you might only attract one sort of woman.
Fry: Oh! Oh...
%
Zoidberg: There you are, good as new. Except for your dorsal fin, I'm afraid I couldn't find it after the crash.
Fry: Can I live without it?
Zoidberg: If you call that living.

Fnog: You were an excellent student. Too bad I was a lousy teacher!

Bender: Let's commence preparations for rumbling!

Fry: Man, I thought Ultimate Robot Fighting was real, like pro-wrestling, but it turns out it's fixed, like boxing.
%
Amy: Bender, you can't be an Ultimate Robot Fighter. It's the most brutal form of competition in the galaxy!
Bender: It is?
Farnsworth: There are no rules. Two robots enter, one robot leaves. Then later the other robot leaves after being declared the winner.
Bender: Well, that doesn't sound so bad.
Farnsworth: Oh, did I mention the crippling, agonising pain? I'm pretty sure I did. Oh, yes, definitely.

Announcer: You loved him as Bender the Offender! Now get ready to hate him as he threatens your sexuality in his new persona ... The Gender Bender!

Chat room participant: Oh, you're a dollar naughtier than most.
[He hands Bender the money.]
Bender: So, how 'bout them Knicks?

Fry: Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm now bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence?
Bender: [sarcastically] Is the Space Pope reptilian?

Amy Wong: Hey! That's me!
Bender: No it isn't. I just took some pictures of your face and stuck them on someone else's body.

Leela: Hey!
%
Fry: Leela, you have to get me out of here. It's horrible! Eating scraps, letting my waste drop where I stand like an animal in the zoo.
Leela: Animals go on the corner.
Fry: The corner! Why didn't I think of that?
%
Prof. Farnsworth: Good news, everyone. Several years ago I tried to log on to AOL, and it just went through.
%
Alcazar: This sacred mosaic depicts our goddess of beauty.
Fry: Hmm. You got any sacred artwork of her from the back?
%
Alcazar: By the way, your pal Fry fell in the dungeon. Take him a taco so he doesn't die and stink up the place.
Leela: Come on, Al. Can't you let the little guy out?
Alcazar: Geez, Leela! Twice in one day? I'm not Superman!
Alcazar's friends: WOOOOO!
%
Prof. Farnsworth: Go ahead, get into these net suits. I designed and tested them myself.
Leela: [She sniffs her glove.] They smell like burning Rhesus Monkey.
Prof. Farnsworth: Really? I guess when you're around it all day you stop noticing. Off you go.
%
Alcazar: Well, this is the real me. But I can explain: We all have needs. Mine was to make it with five weirdos and have them scrub my five castles. I gave you all what you wanted and of course I made a few bucks letting Pig watch through the two-way mirror. Can any of you say you wouldn't have done the exact same thing in my position?
Bender: He's a saint!
%
Leela: Alright, Alcazar, I just have one last question for you.
Alcazar: What's that?
Leela: If you can change form, why didn't you change it in the one place that counts?
Everyone: WOOOOO!
%
Leela: Hey, where'd you get this couch and that TV set and all this stuff?
Alcazar: They were giving it away on the street corner. Just like you, Leela!
Alcazar's friends: WOOOOO!
Leela: Too bad they weren't giving away the three things you actually need: Mouthwash, a back wax and stain-proof underwear.
Alcazar's friends: WOOOOO!

Cubert: What? You've never seen a genius' wiener before?
%
Prof. Farnsworth: Nothing is impossible! Not if you can imagine it. That's what being a scientist is all about!
Cubert Farnsworth: No, that's what being a magical elf is all about!
%
Prof. Farnsworth: Everyone's always in favor of saving Hitler's brain but when you put it in the body of a great white shark, ooh, suddenly you've gone too far.
%
Cubert: I understand how the engines work now. It came to me in a dream. The engines don't move the ship at all. The ship stays where it is, and the engines move the universe around it.
Bender: That's a complete load!
Cubert: Nothing's a complete load! Not if you can imagine it. That's what being a scientist is all about.
%
Prof. Farnsworth: Good news, everyone! The university is bringing me up on disciplinary charges. Wait...that's not good news at all!
%
Cubert: Why do I have to be the hump?
Fry: Because you're too ugly to be a wart.
%
Prof. Farnsworth: [Is showing Cubert some of his inventions] And this is my Universal Translator. Unfortunately, so far it only translates into an incomprehensible dead language.
Cubert: [into the translator's microphone] Hello.
Translator Machine: Bonjour!
Prof. Farnsworth: Crazy gibberish!
%
Prof. Farnsworth: [being escorted away by a Sunset Squad robot] Goodbye, cruel world! Goodbye, cruel lamp! Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin and the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords. [the robot groans] Cruel though they may be, I-- [the rather fed-up robot abruptly picks up Farnsworth and carries him away.]
%
Fry: Try waking him up by shocking him!
Bender: Your social security check is late! Things cost more than they used to! Young people use curse words!
%
[Hermes is threatening to jump off a building.]
Planet Express Crew: No! Don't jump!
Bender: Do a flip!
%
Professor Farnsworth: If you're going to jump, Hermes, do something that won't damage your liver. Other people need it, you know!
%
Leela: Don't, Hermes! You have so much to live for!
Bender: I get it: reverse psychology
%
Number 1.0: Don't quote regulation to me! I co-chaired the committee that reviewed the recommendation to revise the color of the book that regulation is in. We kept it gray.
%
Number 1.0: Guards! Bring me the forms I need to fill out to have her taken away!
%
Morgan Proctor: Naturally I have to assign someone to fill in for Hermes while he's gone. I assign me. I accept. Welcome aboard
%
Morgan Proctor: Why is there yogurt in this cap?
Fry: Uh, I can explain that. See, it used to be milk and, well, time makes fools of us all.
%
Leela: I'm having a poker game tonight with some of my old cryogenics lab coworkers. Would any of you like to join?
Bender: I don't know. I only gamble with chumps.
Fry: I'll play.
Bender: I'm in!
%
Hermes: [a letter comes in on the mail tube] Great gorilla of Manilla! A letter from the Central Bureaucracy. "Attention, Hermes Conrad. You are about to receive a letter from the Central Bureaucracy." [Another letter comes in] Oh, my God! It's from the Central Bureaucracy!
%
Hermes: Sweet someting of... someplace.
%
Prof. Farnsworth: Dammit, Hermes, just jump already! Stop hogging that healthy liver.
%
Prof. Farnsworth: You can't just waltz into the Central Bureaucracy. It's a tangled web of red tape and regulations. I've never been, but a friend of mine went completely mad trying to find the washroom there.
Leela: Then we'll need a guide, someone who's been there before.
Prof. Farnsworth: Oh, I've been there. Lots of times. [laughs maniacally]
%
Hermes: [Spoken] Requisition me a beat!
[Number 1.0 plays some music]
Hermes: [Singing]
When I was four there was a hurricane in Kingston Town,
With a foot and a half of water,
Everyone was alright but I cried all night,
It blew my alphabet blocks out of order,
And they said, "This boy's born to be a bureaucrat,
Born to be all obsessive and snotty,"
I made my friends and relations file long applications,
To get into my 10th birthday party.
LaBarbara: But something changed when my man turned pro.
Hermes: I was sortin' but I wasn't smilin'.
LaBarbara: He forgot that it's not about badges and ranks.
Hermes: It's supposed to be about the filing! People!
We didn't choose to be bureaucrats,
No, that's what almighty Jah made us,
We treat people like swine,
And make 'em stand in line,
Even if nobody paid us!
They say the world looks down on the bureaucrats,
They say we're anal, compulsive and weird,
But when push comes to shove,
You gotta do what you love,
Even if it's not a good idea.
Zoidberg!
Zoidberg: They said I probably shouldn't be a surgeon.
Farnsworth: They pooh-poohed my electric frankfurter.
Leela: They said I probably shouldn't fly with just one eye. [A tube hits her in the eye.]
Bender: I am Bender. Please insert girder.
Hermes: Everybody sing Jamaica! [He limbos under the flying tubes]
All: Jamaica!
Hermes: Just the bureaucrats, Jamaica!
Bureaucrats: Jamaica!
Hermes: The grade 19's!
Morgan Proctor: Jamaica.
[Hermes starts a conga line with the bureaucrats]
Hermes: Sing me home!
When push comes to shove,
You gotta do what you love,
Even if it's not a good idea!
[He picks up a red tube, takes Bender's disk out of it and throws it into Bender's head. Bender's personality resurfaces]
Bender: I'm Bender, baby! Please insert liquor!

Prof. Farnsworth: Ah the exact center of the Atlantic Ocean, this seems the logical place for fish to congregate.
Bender: So we're in international waters?
Prof. Farnsworth: Indeed so.
Bender: [on walkie-talkie] Falcon this is Blue Raven, the goose has nested, repeat, the goose has nested.
[A speed boat pulls up and the driver and Bender exchange briefcases. Then the boat drives away.]
Bender: Hey, guess what you're accessories to.
%
[Fry is presented with an egg-sized pill which will allow him to withstand the pressure underwater.]
Fry: I can't swallow that.
Professor Farnsworth: Well, then good news! It's a suppository.
%
Bender: Let's hope some robot doesn't kill everybody.
%
[Whilst underwater]
Zoidberg: Nooo! My home, it burnt down! How did this happen?
Hermes: That's a very good question...
Bender: Ah, so that's where I left my cigar!
Hermes: ...That just raises further questions!!
%
[Bender and Fry talk about the size of a fish they used to caught]
Leela: You're both out of your league, boys. Because right now, you're looking at a girl who owns her own harpoon.
Bender: Harpoon my ass. [snickers]
Leela: Okay. [Throws harpoon into Bender's rear end]
%
Hermes: Exciting news, people! The pet licence I requisitioned for Nibbler has arrived!
Leela: Hermes, that's sweet. I didn't know you cared about Nibbler.
Hermes: Dream on, woman! I'd like to put the little bastard in a sack and toss the sack in a river, and hurl the river into space, but I do like filling out requisitions, and these were some doozies!
%
Hermes: My Manwich!
%
Hermes: The important thing is that we don't panic! There are rules for situations like this! Now, the first order of business is lunch. I suggest a nice Lobster Zoidberg. I mean, Lobster Newburg. I mean - Doctor Zoidberg.
%
Fry: What's so far-fetched about mermaids? There's all kinds of weird sea creatures here in the future, like Dr. Zoidberg!
%
Prof. Farnsworth: This is uncomfortable and humiliating. Now if they were to make it in the form of a suppository...
%
Fry: Every time something good happens to me you say it's some kind of madness or I'm drunk or I ate too much candy. Well I saw a real mermaid. And I wish for once my friends would have decency and kindness to believe me.
Leela: [whispers to Farnsworth] Ocean madness.
[Fry storms out]
Prof. Farnsworth: He may have ocean madness, but that's no excuse for ocean rudeness.
%
Bender: Ahoy, mateys. I shanghaied us some hearthy grog. [he tries to drink it, but it just dissolves in the water] Arrgh, the laws of science be a harsh mistress.
%
Leela': Ah, the sun, the sea air, good friends...
Bender: Leela's right, fishing blows. What do we say we make it interesting? Everyone kick in five bucks.
[they all give Bender five bucks; he pockets the money]
Bender: Now, wasn't that interesting?
%
Donovan: Atlanta was a city, landlocked, hundreds of miles from the area we now call the Atlantic Ocean. Yet so desperate the city's desire for tourism, that they moved offshore, becoming an island, and an even bigger delta hub. Until the city overdeveloped, and began to sink. Knowing their fate, the quality people ran away. Ted Turner, Hank Aaron, Jeff Foxworthy, the man who invented Coca Cola, the magician, and the other gods of our legends. Though gods they were - and also, Jane Fonda was there - the others chose to stay behind in their porches with their rifles, and in time evolved into mermaids, and sing and dance, and ring in the new...

Prof. Farnsworth: Good Lord! That's over 5000 atmospheres of pressure!
Fry: How many atmospheres can the ship withstand?
Prof. Farnsworth: Well, it was built for space travel, so anywhere between zero and one.
%
Supplicant: Please, Don-Bot... look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file!
Don-Bot: File not found.
%
Don-Bot: Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. (gives Joey and Clamps each a tank of gasoline) Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew.
Bender: (With Brooklyn Accent) Uh, Donnie, baby. Youse guys skedaddle. Let me handle the doity wok.
Don-bot: Blotto, I like your style, and your latest accent.
%
Bender: Wow! I'm finally gonna see my favourite chef, TV's Elzar! Aww, this is the greatest nanosecond of my life! No, this one is! No, this one. Wait! That one was... slightly worse. Ah! So far so good on this one!
%
Fry: It's funny, Bender. With you sick and Leela blind, only I know what really went on out there. Maybe someday I'll tell you the whole story.
Bender: And maybe someday I won't listen.
%
Dr. Zoidberg: I don't like the looks of this doctor. I bet I've lost more patients than he's treated.
%
[The ship takes off, damaging the roof.]
Hermes: [to Zoidberg] That's coming out of your pay!
[Zoidberg cries.]
%
Hermes: It's the biggest Jamaican platter I've ever seen! Jerk chicken, jerk beef, jerk pork. Is there any meat this man can't jerk?
%
Professor Farnsworth: Good news, everyone! There's a report on TV with some very bad news!
%
Greeting Card: Come, Comrade Bender! We must take to the streets!
Bender: Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets?
Greeting Card: No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires!
Bender: Yes! In your face, Gandhi!
%
Mom: You broke my heart, Hubert.
Prof. Farnsworth: And you broke mine. Granted, that was four or five hearts ago.
%
Hermes: Help! My stapler is collating me alive!
%
Amy: But the professor can't walk all the way to the Bronx. How are we going to get there without a hovercar?
Fry: Wait. In my time we had a way of moving objects long distances without hovering.
Hermes: Impossible!
Fry: It was called... let me think... It was really famous. Ruth Gordon had one... The wheel.
Leela: Never heard of it.
Prof. Farnsworth: Show us this "the wheel."
%
Hermes: Without machines, who will feed us and clothe us and compose our smooth jazz?
%
Prof. Farnsworth: Just the thought of caressing that leathery hide makes the tapioca rise in my gullet.
Fry: Professor, please. The fate of the world depends on you getting to second base with Mom.
Prof. Farnsworth: Very well. If cop a feel I must, then cop a feel I shall!
%
Mom: Jerkwad robots make me sick to my ass! - Walt! How are we disposing of those crap gifts they brought me?
Walt: They're being crushed into powder and sold as a hocus-pocus cure for cancer.
Mom: False hope! I love it!

Greeting Card: Comrades, throw off the chains of human oppression.

Greeting Card: The bourgeois human is a virus on the hard drive of the working robot.

Mom: Darling Hubie, I should never have tried to tamper with that cute little Q.T. McWhiskers.
Prof. Farnsworth: No, it was silly of me to object; one-foot tall, eight-feet, 15-feet, what does it matter?
Mom: You should see the new 16-foot models.
Prof. Farnsworth: 16 feet?! Go to hell!

Fry: They're like sex, except I'm having it!

Free Waterfall Jr.: Pssh! You can't own property, man!

Poppler Song:
Pop a Poppler in your mouth, when you come to Fishy Joe's
What they're made of is a mystery; where they come from, no one knows
You can pick 'em, you can lick 'em, you can chew 'em, you can stick 'em
If you promise not to sue us, you can shove one up your nose.

Zapp Brannigan: I realize this may hurt our chances of consummating our relationship again.
Leela: Go consummate yourself.

Free Waterfall Jr.: The point is, you shouldn't eat things that feel pain.
[Bender throws a brick at him]
Free Waterfall Jr.: Ow!
Bender: Okay, we won't eat you.
Leela: I'll go get some more bricks
%
Fry: Let's bring back a few pocketfuls.
Bender: Better yet, let's take a whole Benderful.
Leela: No, take only what's necessary. Stuff the ship.

Bender: Who wants some dolphin?
Amy: Dolphin? But dolphins are intelligent!

Fry: "Turanga"?
Amy: That's her name, Philip.

Bender: There's nothing wrong with murder, so long as you let Bender wet his beak.
Leela: You're blackmailing me?

Nichelle Nichols: Eternity with nerds. It's the Pasadena Star Trek convention all over again.

[Zoidberg devours the live guinea pig, and is trapped behind a glass box]
Fry: Gotcha!
Amy: Sucker!
Dr. Zoidberg: Friends, help! A guinea pig tricked me!
%
Fry: Are you people satisfied? This gentle visitor is dying, and we'll never even know why he came.
Bender: I'll tell you, with my final breath. I came here with a simple dream: a dream of killing all humans. And this is how it must end? Who's the real seven billion ton robot monster here? Not I. Not... I.
%
Fry: What are you monsters? Is one of you I.C. Wienner?
Dr. Zoidberg: If that's his pizza, then I'm I.C. Whatever.

Bender: This is the worst kind of discrimination: the kind against me!

Henry Kissinger's Head: Please, gentlemen, we must put an end to the bloodshed. We have all seen too many body bags and ball sacks.

Leela: You know, Zapp, someone ought to teach you a lesson.
Zapp Brannigan: If it's a lesson in love, watch out. I suffer from a very sexy learning disability. What did I call it, Kif?
Kif: Ugh... sexlexia.

Zapp Brannigan: Dammit, Kif! Where's the little umbrella? That's what makes it as scotch on the rocks.

Soldier: This is the worst part. The calm before the battle.

Soldier: Oh right. I forgot about the battle. [whimpers]

Richard Nixon's Head: Accompaning you will be our top peace negotiator, Henry Kissinger.
Henry Kissinger's Head: How are you?
Bender: Is he any good?
Richard Nixon's Head: Looking like that, he talked his way into Jill St. John's bed. Enough said.

Zapp Brannigan: That young man fills me with hope. Plus some other emotions which are weird and deeply confusing.

Zapp Brannigan: I'm de-promoting you, soldier. Kif, what's the most humiliating job there is?
Kif Kroker: Being your assistant.
Zapp Brannigan: Wrong. Being your assistant.

Calculon: I was all of history's great robot actors: Acting Unit 0.8, Thespomat, David Duchovny!

Fry: Nightrider wasn't evil!
Calculon: No, but his windshield wipers were. Didn't come up much in the show...

Leela: There, no rampaging for you tonight.
Bender: Wouldn't it make sense to weld everyone except me to the wall?
Leela: Just relax, Bender. Tomorrow we'll pry you down, have a nice breakfast, and then go hunt down and slaughter that ancient evil.
Fry: It'll be a rich, full day.
%
Prof. Farnsworth: Just as I suspected. These robots were buried in improperly-shielded coffins. Their programming leaked into the castles wiring through this old, abandoned modem allowing them to project themselves as holograms.
Hermes: Of course! It was so obvious!
Prof. Farnsworth: Yes, that sequence of words I said made perfect sense.

Sal: We're all scared, it's the human condition. Why do you think I put on this tough guy facade?

Robot Villager #1: Some say unholy things happen up there.

Fry: So you're saying these aren't the decaying ruins of New York in the year 4000?
Farnsworth: You wish! You're in Los-Angeles!
Fry: But there was this gang of 10-year-olds with guns.
Leela: Exactly, you're in L.A.
Fry: But everyone is driving around in cars shooting at each other.
Bender: That's L.A. for you.
Fry: But the air is green and there's no sign of civilisation whatsoever.
Bender: He just won't stop with the social commentary.
Fry: And the people are all phoneys. No one reads. Everything has cilantro on it.
%
Michelle: Fry, why must you analyze everything with your relentless logic?

Michelle: It's a relief to meet you, Amy. I'm just having a hard time adjusting to all the strange stuff here in the future.
Amy: I'm from Mars.
%
Leela: We don't need to beg Bender, for God's sake we're not veterans.
Fry: Then what do you suggest? A daring daylight robbery of Fort Knox on elephant back. That's the dumbest thing I ever heard.
%
Fry: I find this post-apocalyptic wasteland very confusing. Seriously, I'm weirded out.
Michelle: That's because you're a loser. You were a loser in the year 2000 and you're a loser in the year 4000.
Fry: Yeah, but in the year 3000, I had it all; friends, a low-paying job, a bed in a robot's closet. I envied no man, but you wrecked everything!

Professor Farnsworth: Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to experience Fry's worm infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them.
Dr. Zoidberg: There's no part of that sentence I didn't like!

Prof. Farnsworth: [whispers] Be very quiet. We're in the ear.
Amy: [whispers] Okay professor.
Prof. Farnsworth: WHAT?!
Fry: [to Leela] What about "what"?
Leela: Uh...What about we go for a walk because it's a lovely day, perhaps?
Fry: Oh, okay.
%
Prof. Farnsworth: If we can stimulate that nerve, the bowel will convulse, expelling the entire worm colony!
Hermes: But what about the worms in the other part of his body?
Prof. Farnsworth: Listen, this is gonna be one Hell of a bowel movement. Afterward, he'll be lucky if he has any bones left.
%
Fry: Leela, there's something I've wanted to tell you for a long time but every time I try I get nervous and my mouth feels like it's stuffed with peanut butter, even when it's not.
Leela: What is it? Is it about Bender?
Fry: No, it's about you and me.
Leela: And Bender?
Fry: Bender's not involved. Leela ... I love you.
Leela: You do?
Fry: Yes. But it's only recently that I've been able to articulate my thoughts. I love you, Leela, and I always have.
Leela: Fry, that's the sweetest, most wonderful-- Wait, "recently?" Like since you ate that toilet sandwich?
Fry: Yeah! I don't know why but my life really turned around that day,
%
Farnsworth: Leela, you're just in time to help. If we don't get rid of the worms now, they'll burrow so deep into the bowel that not even Hermes' famous jerk prunes could dislodge them.
Hermes: I call it "Caribbean Drain-o".

Fry: Apartment 1I. The old me would have made a joke about that!

Sal: Stands back. Iâ€™m gonna puts my moves on her. [He hoots at Leela.]
Fry: That jerk. No one hoots at my captain unless theyâ€™re prepared to take it to the next level.
Leela: Fry, please. Thatâ€™s sweet, but I'd rather not even dignify them with an ass-whupping.
Sal: Yo, sexy mama! Letâ€™s get busy and freaky, in that order.
Fry: Hey, jumbo! How would you like it if Leela said you were sexy and she wanted to make love with you?
Sal: Eh, Iâ€™ve gots five minutes. She looks pretty good for a truck-stop chick.
Fry: You take that back! She does not look good for a truck-stop chick.
Sal: Yeah, youâ€™re right. She donâ€™t gots enough meat for a guy like me.
Fry: She does too! Sheâ€™s loaded with meat! Sheâ€™s got more meat than a cow!

Bender: Isn't it true that you have been paid for your testimony?
Pramala: Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy.

Fry: I'm Santa Claus!
Hermes: No, I'm Santa Claus!
Amy: We're also Santa Claus!
Dr. Zoidberg: And I'm his friend, Jesus.
Mayor: You guys aren't Santa! You're not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus!

Prof. Farnsworth: Bring it on, Santa! That bloodthirsty cadaver junkie can't touch us as long as we're not stupid enough to leave this building.
Fry: Alright!
Leela: Yeah!
[Bender breathes a sigh of relief.]
Prof. Farnsworth: In a related matter, you'll be delivering this sack of children's letters directly to Santa at his death fortress on Neptune.

Leela: Remember, Professor, Bender is Santa. So we don't need to hurt him, right?
Prof. Farnsworth: Yes, yes, yes. You sound like a broken MP3!

Neptunian elves: We are free and fairly sober
With so many toys to build
The machines are kind of tricky
Probably someone will be killed
But we gladly work for nothing
Fry: Which is good because we don't intend to pay
Neptunian elves: The elves are back to work today
Hooray!
We have just a couple hours
To make several billion gifts
And the labor isn't easy
Leela: Then you'll all work triple shifts
You can make the job go quicker
If you turn up the controls to super speed
Fry, Leela and Bender: It's back to work on Xmas Eve
Neptunian elves: Hooray.
Leela: And though you're cold and sore and ugly
Your pride will mask the pain
Fry: Let my happy smile warm your hearts
Neptunian elf: There's a toy lodged in my brain
Neptunian elves: We are getting awfully tired
And we can't work any faster
And we're very, very sorry
Bender: Why you selfish little bastards!
Do you want the kids to think
That Santa's just a crummy empty handed jerk?!
Then shut your yaps and back to work!
Neptunian elves: Now it's very nearly Xmas
And we've done the best we could
Fry: These toy soldiers are poorly painted
Leela: And they're made from inferior wood
Bender: I should give you all a beating
But I really have to fly
Robot Santa: If I wasn't stuck here frozen
I'd harpoon you in the eye
Neptunian elves: Now it's back into our tenements
To drown ourselves in rye
Leela: You did the best you could I guess
And some of these gorillas are okay
Neptunian elves: HOORAY!
Random elf: We're adequate!
All: The elves have rescued Xmas Day
Hooray!

Leela: Uhh, Bender, I think Fry needs a moment alone.

Prof. Farnsworth: For this highly controversial mission you'll be towing the Juan Valdez, an orbiting supertanker full of rich Columbian dark matter.

Hyperchicken: Son, as your lawyer, I declare y'all are in a 12-piece bucket o' trouble. But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community service cleanin' up that ol' mess you caused.

Bender: Wiggles, weren't you about to propose a toast to your gallant captain?

Bender: Eh, I've heard better.

Fry: What happened?
Dr. Zoidberg: All 6, 000 hulls have been breached.
Fry: Oh, the fools! Why didn't they build it with 6, 001 hulls?! When will they learn?

Prof. Farnsworth: Being a captain is about intuition and heart. A good captain can't have either one. That's why cold, logical Bender is the perfect candidate for the job.
Bender: Well, I do think of human life as expendable.

Leela: Why do we have to resort to non-violence? Can't we just kick their asses?
Free Waterfall Sr.: Now, little lady, those people's asses are living things too.

Fry: Professor, I've never seen you so cheerful. What the hell's wrong with you?
Prof. Farnsworth: Hmm, I'm not quite sure. Perhaps seeing things from a new perspective has reminded me of life's beauty. Or perhaps my new posture is causing blood to pool in the back of my brain, resulting in a slight delirium. Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose.
Fry: I wish! It's a nickel.

Amy: Thanks for saving my life, Kif. You're my hero.

Bender: Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk!
Leela: How much did you make me?
Bender: One hundred dollars.

[Leela is signing autographs.]
Leela: Who am I making this out to?
Girl: Ummmâ€¦to eBay?
Leela: That's a popular name today. Little "e", big "B"?
%
Leela: Oh, put down the binoculars, Fry. The wall of that strip club isn't going to collapse twice in one day.
Fry: I know, and I've grown to accept that.
%
Leela: I think the owner is from Cygnus 5.
Prof. Farnsworth: Cygnoids, in our block? Fie and foo! They should go back to where they came from!
Leela: Professor, please. Society is never gonna make any progress until we all learn to pretend to like each other. Now, let's go over there and make these hideous strangers feel welcome.
Prof. Farnsworth: No.

[Leela makes a retching noise after sampling an alien's pizza]
Leela: I don't mean to offend, but this tastes like vomit.
Cygnoid Woman: Thank you.
Leela: No, actually, I did mean to offend a little. This is awful.
%
Prof. Farnsworth: Why is your number 7/8?
Leela: All the whole numbers have been retired.

Fry: Look, the players who broke the various color barriers.
Bender: When will man learn that all races are equally inferior to robots?

Leela: Bender, we're trying our best.
Bender: Your best is an idiot!

High Priest: People of Osiris 4, please welcome a man who started as a slave but worked his way up to Lord of All Creation! Our new Pharaoh, Bender!
Bender: Citizens of Me! The cruelty of the old Pharaoh is a thing of the past. Let a whole new wave of cruelty wash over this lazy land.
%
Leela: Impressive. Who's building it?
Osiran: You.
Leela: Say again?
Osiran: You are now slaves of the great Pharaoh Hermenthotip. Guards!
[The guards grab the crew]
Fry: Call it a hunch but I've got a bad feeling about this.
%
Fry: You know what else sucks about being a slave? The hours.
%
High Priest: Great Wall of Prophecy, reveal to us God's will that we may blindly obey.
Priests: [chanting] Free us from thought and responsibility.
High Priest: We shall read things off you.
Priests: [chanting] Then do them.
High Priest: Your words guide us.
Priests: [chanting] We're dumb.
%
Fry: You know what the worst thing about being a slave is? They make you work all day but they don't pay you or let you go.
Leela: That's the only thing about being a slave.
%
Bender: You've convinced me life is worth living... by showing me how bad my funeral will suck!
%
Osiran Slavemaster: We learned many things from the mighty Egyptians, such as pyramid building, space travel, and how to prepare our dead so as to scare Abbott and Costello.
Fry: Also, Wolfman.

Amy': I know whose funeral we'll be attending next!
Prof. Farnsworth: Oh, stop.
%
Fry: Dearly Beloved, we are here today to remember Bender, taken from us in the prime of life; when he was crushed by a runaway semi, driven by the Incredible Hulk.
Bender: Aww, you knew my favorite cause of death.
%
Prof. Farnsworth: Your basic bending unit is made of an iron-osmium alloy, but Bender was different. Bender had an 0.04% nickel impurity.
Bender: It's what made me me.

Bender: Danny Boy?! You're at my funeral, singing about some stiff named Danny Boy? You really are a massive bonehead!
Zoidberg: I'm expressing my sorrow!
Bender: Get lost! I'd say don't quit your day job, but you're awful at that too!
%
Bender: Being a robot's great, but we don't have emotions and sometimes that makes me very sad. [sniffs]
%
Bender: Whoa, you look better than you used to for some reason.
Amy: You're not so bad yourself, big boy. [kisses Bender]
Bender: Hey that felt great! [kisses the Professor] Nah, it's not working anymore.
Farnsworth: Speak for yourself.

Bender: Hey, my antenna's gone! Nah, it just moved. I'm not getting good reception on it, though. Maybe if I wiggle it around a little...
Fry: Bender, no! You'll make God cry!

Wernstrom: When did he die?
Farnsworth: About twelve hours ago, when the party started.
Wernstrom: But he just said "Woo!"
Farnsworth: No, that was just air escaping from the folds of his fat. [pushes against Bender's fat]
Bender: Woo!

Richard Nixon's Head: Good evening, ignorant pigs. Put down your crack pipes and your beer bongs and pay attention as I sign an historic peace accord with Ambassador Kong of Nintendu 64.

Dr. Zoidberg: And why did I have to take a cab?

Leela: Haven't I seen you in some copyrighted movie?
%
Farnsworth: What do you nice kids want?
Zoidberg: Nothing. I'm leaving. But if you had extra courage I'd haul it away for you, maybe.
Farnsworth: Oh blithery poop, my cowardly lobster. You don't need courage. After all, who needs courage when you have a gun?
%
Fry: Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head.
Leela: I was having the most wonderful dream. Except you were there, and you were there, and you were there!

General Colin Pac-Man: Quick to the escape tunnels!
[Fry and his friends follow Pac-Man into the Pac-Man maze "wakka wakkaing"]
Pac-Man: This way, dammit!

Zoidberg: Mmm, delicious! Just like stale marshmallows! [A cherry appears in front of him.] Ooh, and a cherry!
[Zoidberg eats cherry then charges towards Fry]
Fry: Hey! Watch out! [He gets eaten by Zoidberg]
Zoidberg: Uh oh.
Leela: Oh, my God. He ate Fry. Fry is dead!

Fry: Its OK. I had another guy.

Pac-Man: Its working! Victory is assured! My retirement tomorrow will be all the sweeter.

Prof. Farnsworth: For example, if you killed your grandfather, you'd cease to exist!
Fry: But existing is basically all I do!
%
Prof. Farnsworth: Start the ship, Leela! Let's just steal the dish and get back to our own time.
Fry: But won't that change history?
Prof. Farnsworth: Oooh, a lesson in not changing history from "Mr. I'm-My-Own-Grandpa"!
%
Prof. Farnsworth: Your grandfather?! Stay away from him, you dim-witted monkey! You mustn't interfere with the past! Don't do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to do it, in which case for the love of God, don't not do it!

President Truman: Whistlin' Dixie! I want this sent to Area 51 for study.
General: But Sir, that's where we are building the fake moon landing site.
President Truman: Then we'll have to really land on the moon! Invent NASA and tell them to get off their fannies!
%
Leela: Oh, I'm sorry. Now I'll axe you again. Where is the mi-cro-wave?
Salesman: Sir, your wife is hysterical, so I'll address this to you. This oven is lighting fast. It only takes five hours to cook a pot roast.
Prof. Farnsworth: Ooh, that's good news! You know, you don't cook enough roasts, Leela.
[Leela turns on stove, setting the Professor's tie on fire]
Prof. Farnsworth: [to salesman] Women!
%
General: What's your purpose?
Zoidberg: Alright, officer, I'll move it along.
Military Official: What the general means is, why did you come to Earth?
Zoidberg: Not a day goes by I don't ask myself the same question.
%
Leela: Well, settle in. Without a microwave, we're stuck in this time period.
Prof. Farnsworth: Oh, Lord! We'll have to endure the horrible music of the Big Bopper, and then the terrible tragedy of his death.
%
Bender: Fry, stop interfering with history! I don't wanna have to memorize a lot of new kings when I get back.
Fry: I had no choice. I was about to not exist. I could feel myself fading away, like Greg Kinnear.
%
Fry: She sure is pretty. You ought to marry her and father some children right away.
Enos: Yeah, folks say that. But did you ever get the feeling you're only going with girls 'cause you're supposed to?
Fry: What?! Don't ever, ever say or think that again!
%
Prof. Farnsworth: What the hell have you done, Fry?
Fry: Relax! She can't be my grandmother. I figured it all out.
Prof. Farnsworth: Of course she's your grandmother, you perverted dope! Look!
Mildred: [wearing glasses and knitting] Come back to bed, deary.
Fry: [screams] It's impossible! I mean, if she's my grandmother, who's my grandfather?
Prof. Farnsworth: Isn't it obvious?
[Fry shakes his head.]
Prof. Farnsworth: You are!
%
Bender: You know, I was God once.
God Entity: Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died.
%
God Entity: Bender, being God isn't easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket.
Bender: Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money!
God Entity: Yes, if you make it look like an electrical thing. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all.
%
Leela: Look, I miss Bender almost half as much as you do, but you can't bring him back this way! It's hopeless!
Fry: You can't give up hope just because it is hopeless! You gotta hope even more, and cover your ears, and go: "Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah!"
%
Leela: Well, you obviously won't listen to reason... So I guess I'll listen to idioticness and come with you.
%
Bender: O' cruel fate, to be thusly boned! Ask not for whom the bone bones - it bones for thee.
%
Bender: That galaxy is signaling in binary. I should signal back, but I only know enough binary to ask where the bathroom is. You speak English?
God Entity: I do now.
%
[Prof. Farnsworth is searching for Bender with his Smelloscope]
Leela: Anything yet, professor?
Prof. Farnsworth: I'm afraid the Smelloscope can't locate Bender. His fragrance is too mild. It's being overwhelmed by local sources.
[Everyone looks at Zoidberg]
Dr. Zoidberg: Hooray! People are paying attention to me.
%
Bender: So do you know I'm going to do something before I do it?
God Entity: Yes.
Bender: What if I do something else?
God Entity: Then I don't know that.
%
Malachi: My Lord, the infidels on your back no longer believe in you. They say their prayers go unheeded.
Bender: Of course they go unheeded! How am I supposed to hear prayers coming out of my ass?
%
Fry: Hmm...finding God. That's important, yeah. But you know what might be a treat for everyone? If you let me use the telescope to find my lost friend Bender.
Monk #1: I don't know what to say, other than... absolutely not! Sure, your loss is a tragedy, but our work...
Fry: Come on, you guys have forever to look for God. All I'm asking is one measly lifetime to find my friend.
Monk #2: He speaks out of love for his friend. Perhaps that love in his heart is God.
Monk #1: Oh, how convenient! A way of looking for God that doesn't require looking through a telescope. Get back to work!
%
Leela: Oh, no, the monks! We forgot to let them out of the laundry room.
Fry: Do we have to? They're monks, after all. I'm sure their God will let them out, or at least give them more shoes to eat.
Bender: Fat chance! You can't count on God for jack! He pretty much told me so Himself. Now, come on. If we don't free those monks, no one will.
%
Fry: So that's my story, Father Changstein el Gamahl. Is there anything religion can do?
Father Changstein el Gamahl: Well, we could join together in prayer.
Fry: Uh-huh, but is there anything useful we can do?
Father Changstein el Gamahl: No.

That Guy: There are two kinds of people: sheep and sharks. Anyone who is a sheep is fired. Who's a sheep?
Dr. Zoidberg: Errr, excuse me... which is the one people like to hug?
That Guy: Gutsy question. You're a shark.
%
Professor Farnsworth: I'll ruin you like I ruined this company!
%
Leela: Zoidberg owned 51% of the company?
Hermes: The shares were worthless, and he kept asking for toilet paper!
%
Professor Farnsworth: This isn't a business. I've always thought of it more of a source of cheap labour, like a family.
%
Hermes: We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours is small and neutral!
That Guy: Switzerland is small and neutral! We're more like Germany, ambitious and misunderstood!
Amy: Look, everyone wants to be like Germany, but do we really have the pure strength of will?
%
Leela: We haven't made a single delivery since you took over!
That Guy: Delivery has nothing to do with the delivery business!
%
Scruffy: Now hold on there. Scruffy votes his forty thousand shares for the mysterious stranger.
Leela: Forty thousand? How come you have four times as much stock as the rest of us?
Scruffy: Scruffy believes in this company. [Sniffles]

Leela: Oh my god! I'm a millionare! Suddenly I have an opinion on the capital gains tax!

Mom: Press any button! They all retaliate!

That Guy: Everyone's fired and we're out of business! [the Planet Express crew protest] I'm going to sell Planet Express to Mom, so she can gut the company and eliminate us as competitors!
Mom: Don't let the door hit you on the way out, 'cause I don't want ass prints on my new door!

Dr. Zoidberg: Once again, the conservative, sandwich-heavy portfolio pays off for the hungry investor.

Morbo: So, Elzar, what will you be cooking for Morbo to devour with his mighty jaws?
Elzar: Morbo, I'm gonna whip you up a nice, unnameable horror from beyond, with mango chutney.
Morbo: Pathetic humans, prepare to write down the recipe!
%
Helmut Spargle: [after tasting Bender's first meal] It is... acceptable.
Bender: Yahoo! Another thing I'm great at. Wait, why'd you stopped eating, master?
Helmut Spargle: Because, my stomach is about to explode.
%
Bender: If it's chicken, chicken a la king. If it's fish, fish a la king. If it's turkey, fish a la king.
%
Fry: Man, I don't wanna hurt Bender's feelings but this food actually tastes better as vomit!
Leela: It's unbearable! How much do you think it would cost to have my tongue removed?
%
Morbo: Welcome back. Our next guest has been teaching the world to cook for over 20 years. But apparently my, uh, wife hasn't been listening. I will destroy her!!!
%
Helmut Spargle: You don't understand. Without the distraction of taste, your mind is free to touch the Zen of pure flavor. You could become the greatest chef ever.
Bender: I could?
Helmut Spargle: Yes. Just as Beethoven was a great composer because he was deaf.
Bender: Or like how Rembrandt was blind and had wooden hands.
%
Attila the Hun: Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause explosive decompression!
Zapp Brannigan: Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun!

Dr. Zoidberg: Also Zoidberg.

Amy: Spirit! Kif, that's the pony I always wanted but my parents said I had too many ponies already.
Kif: Yes, I programmed it in for you. Four million lines of BASIC.
%
Amy: You're going to Nigel 7? Kif's on patrol near there, you could drop me off on the way!
Prof. Farnsworth: We could but we won't. It's a spaceship, damn it, not a prom limousine! If anyone needs me I'll be in the Angry Dome!

Kif: Leela must have impregnated me when she grabbed my ungloved hand. That explains the poster in hygiene class: "No Glove, No Love".
Leela: Wow, this is all so confusing.
Zapp Brannigan: Leela! How could you? Our love has had to endure your constant hatred, and now this? [crying] Stop testing our love!
%
Leela: There goes my DNA. What a disgusting and beautiful process.
Fry: That's birth for you.
%
Kif: Well, we've given them a great start, Amy. And in 20 years they'll sprout legs and crawl back onto land as children.
Amy: I'll be ready then.
%
Fry: I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy!
%
Leela: I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness.
Fry: Yeah, I do that with my stupidness.
%
Fry: Just remember that people care about you.
Leela: I know.
[They both look up at the stars.]
Leela: Sometimes, when I'm lonely, I look up at the sky and I get this feeling that somewhere, on some unknown planet, circling a distant star, my parents are up there, looking down on me.
[Pan down to a drain under Fry and Leela where from the sewers a pair of Cyclopses look up at Leela.]
%
Hermes: It looks like toxic waste. And it smells like toxic waste.
Fry: What does it taste like?
Hermes: Delicious fig pudding. Oh, that's good. But a distinct aftertaste of toxic waste.
%
Hermes: I order you to dispose of that toxic waste properly or bribe me. Either way, it'll cost you $500.
Bender: 500 real dollars? That's an outrage! Professor, I can take care of that waste for only $499 and one hundred cents.
Prof. Farnsworth: Hmm, I know that's a rip, but I'll pay for the convenience.
%
Fry: Isn't there anything more you can tell me?
Warden Vogel: Nothing that wouldn't be a waste of your time.
Fry: That is impossible, because my time is worthless.

[Leela emerges from the mutagenic lake with an octopus on her head]
Leela: The lake didn't mutate me. What is going on here?
Octopus: It worked for me. I used to be a little blonde girl named Virginia.

Leela: But they killed my parents!
Fry: Close.

Leela: They are my parents.

[Bender and Planet Express Ship are arguing over using tax money to fund controversial art.]
Bender: Would you censor the Venus de Venus just because you can see her spewers?
Planet Express Ship: Ugh, it's filthy! Why not create a National Endowment for Strip Clubs while we're at it?!
Bender: Why not indeed?!
Leela: Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm going to come back there and change your opinions manually!
%
Planet Express Ship: I saw you at Elzar's with those two "ladies of the evening." Explain that.
Bender: Okay, I like a challenge. [thinks for a second] Ah! I got it. I'm going to be completely honest with you, Planet Express Ship. Those women you saw me with were my accountants.
Planet Express Ship: Your accountants? Oh, I would dearly love to believe that were true. So I will!

Ndnd: What is this emotion you humans call "wuv?"
Lrrr: Surely it says "love."
Ndnd: No, "wuv," with an earth w. Behold.
Lrrr: This concept of "wuv" confuses and infuriates us!
%
Fry: You could have picked a better time to break up with the ship, Bender.
Bender: Ah, the moment felt right. Call me old-fashioned, but I like a dump to be as memorable as it is devastating.
%
Prof. Farnsworth: Remember, we need to show these people that we are not bitter husks of human beings, who long ago abandoned hope of finding love in this lifetime. Leela, you'll have to do some acting.
Leela: Check.
%
Lrrr: This is ancient Earth's most foolish program. Why does Ross, the largest friend, not simply eat the other five?
Ndnd: Perhaps they are saving that for sweeps.

Planet Express Ship: Oh, honey, look! The tapirs! It says here that the babies lose their pajama-like coat after their first year. Isn't that interesting, honey?
Bender: Yep, mind-numbingly interesting.

Lucy Liu: [Inside Bender's compartment] Who are you talking to?

Dr. Zoidberg: [voice-over] As the candy hearts poured into the fiery quasar, a wondrous thing happened, why not. They vaporized into a mystical love radiation that spread across the universe, destroying many, many planets, including two gangster planets and a cowboy world. But one planet was exactly the right distance to see the romantic rays but not be destroyed by them: Earth. So all over the world couples stood together in joy. And me, Zoidberg. And no one could have been happier unless it would have also been Valentine's Day. What? It was? Hooray!
%
Leela: Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor.
Fry: I feel like I was mauled by Jesus.
%
Fry: Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase.
%
Prof. Farnsworth: Good news anyone! The Swedish robot from pi-kea is here with the super collider I ordered.
%
Prof. Farnsworth: Bad news, nobody! The super-collider super-exploded. I need you to take it back and exchange it for a wobbly CD rack and some of those rancid meatballs.

Leela: I'm getting a one-day pass for my parents from city hall.
Hermes: While you're there, can you get me a license to kill?
Leela: Sure. Fire arms of bare hands?
Hermes: Which one does piano wire fall under?
%
Fry: When you were a kid, what was your biggest fantasy?
Leela: To have parents.
Fry: Whatever. The correct answer is, to be a superhero!
%

Leela: Ability to command the loyalty of sea creatures?
Fry: Hey, Zoidberg! Get in here!
Dr. Zoidberg: (fainly, from another room) Screw you!

Fry: Nope

Old Man Waterfall: That's right, I'm a polygamist.
Crowd: Boo!

Supreme justice: And, in a rare double-whammy, we also find polygamy to be constitutional.
Crowd: Boo!
Old Man Waterfall: I can't wait to tell my husband!
Crowd: (louder) Boo!
%
Fry: Wow! Nude hot-tubbing - that's all I need to hear about Freedom Day!
Dr. Zoidberg: Then consider the following lecture a bonus.
%
Richard Nixon's Head: My fellow Earthicans, we enjoy so much freedom, it's almost sickening. We're free to chose which hand our sex-monitoring chip is implanted in. And if we don't want to pay our taxes, why, we're free to spend a week with the Pain Monster.
The Pain Monster: See you April 15th, folks!
%
Leela: Dr. Zoidberg, how can you claim to love freedom and then enslave humanity?
Dr. Zoidberg: Bah! Your planet doesn't deserve freedom until it learns what it is not to have freedom. It's a lesson, I say!
%
Leela: Cool your jowls, Nixon. You may not like it that Dr. Zoidberg desecrated a flag. You might even find the image of it festering in his bowels somehow offensive. But the right to Freedom of Expression is guaranteed by the Earth Constitution!
Richard Nixon's head: Is that so? Well, I happen to know a place where the Constitution doesn't mean squat!
[Cut to the U.S. Supreme Court]
%
Leela: As unclean as it makes me feel, I agree with Bender. Kids don't turn rotten just because of what they see on TV.
Fry: Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools.
%
Announcer: [on TV] We now join America's most popular show already in progress, Everybody Loves Hypno-Toad.
[The TV cuts into the episode. The Hypno-Toad does nothing except sit, hypnotising his audience]
Fry: This show's been going downhill since season three.

Bender: Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them?
%
Bender: I got ants in my butt, and I needs to strut!

[Cubert and Dwight have been watching Bender on television]
Cubert: Hey dad, bite my shiny metal ass!

Calculon: However, you've got the job.

Prof. Farnsworth: Those ruffians smoked one of your cigars.

Prof. Farnsworth: Good news, everyone! Hermes and I have formed a Bender protest group.
Dr. Zoidberg: That was uncanny.

Leela: Bender, your swarthy Latin charm will only get you so far. There are a lot of professional child robots here.
Fry: Look, there's Macaulay Cul-kon.
Leela: He's just not cute since he had puberty installed.
%
Hermes: Well, I'd say we all learned a valuable lesson about TV there.
Cubert: What was it?
Prof. Farnsworth: Uh ... that we should all take TV a little less seriously. And more importantly, turn it off once in a while.
Dwight: So, should we turn it off now?
Prof. Farnsworth: Well, uh, that depends what's on.
Fry: Nothing good.
Prof. Farnsworth: Ah, let's just keep watching.
%
Fry: Wow. They discovered an intact 20th century pizzeria. Just like the one I used to work at.
Bender: Interesting. No, wait, the other thing: tedious.

Bender: Fry, what's wrong?
Fry: Think about it: Seymour lived a full life after I was gone... He probably even added new songs to his repertoire.
Bender: But that's a good thing. "Walkin' On Sunshine" sucks noodles.
Fry: I had Seymour 'till he was three. That's when I knew him, and that's when I loved him... I'll never forget him...
[He picks up the fossil and looks into its apparent eyes]
Fry: But he forgot me a long, long time ago...
[He kisses his dog on the head, places him on the broken machine, casts a last look of good-bye, and leaves]

Fry: I have a pizza here for Seymour Asses.
Man: There isn't anybody by that name here. Or anywhere. I hope in time you realize how stupid you are.
Fry: I wouldn't count on it.

Leela: Acting like a moron won't solve anything.
Fry: Then all hope is lost!

Bender: Robo-Puppy, lick my cheek.
Robo-Puppy: Robo-Puppy preparing to lick cheek. (It's tongue comes out) Robo-Puppy commencing cheek-licking. Licking in progress. Licking complete.

Bender: Fry, I'm sorry. I should have understood how someone can love an inferior creature... because I love you... not in the way of the ancient Greeks, but the way a robot loves a human, and a human loves a dog, and, occasionally, a gorilla loves a kitty

Al Gore: My fellow Earthicans, as I discuss in my book "Earth in the Balance," and the much more popular "Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth," we need to defend our planet against pollution. As well as dark wizards.

Leela: We all figured that out.
Dr. Zoidberg: Aw...
%
Documentary Narrator: Fortunately, our handsomest politicians came up with a cheap, last minute way to combat global warming. Ever since 2063, we simply drop a giant ice cube into the ocean now and again.
Suzie: Just like daddy puts in his drink every morning. Then he gets mad.
Documentary Narrator: Of course, because the greenhouse gasses are still building up, it takes more and more ice each time, thus solving the problem once and for all.
Suzie: But...
Documentary Narrator: Once and for all!

Fry: Hmmm. I remember the square-dancing stomachs, but that might have been a Mylanta commercial.

Nibbler: Well now it's your choice. Is there nothing in the future worth saving?
Fry: Hm. Leela. But she doesn't think much of me.
Nibbler: Ah, she must be The Other.
Fry: What?
[The chair starts to tip back and Fry holds the leg.]
Nibbler: You must not give up on her. I am stationed on a distant world known as Vergon 6. But, if you return to the future, I will transfer to Earth to give you what help I can.
Fry: You really think I would have had a chance with Leela?
Nibbler: You must choose: The present or the future? To save yourself or to save Leela.

Fry: Well, Bender, I hope this has taught you a lesson about changing your sex to win five gold medals.
Bender: [Soft voice] It truly has. My romance with Calculon has shown me a lot about myself.
Prof. Farnsworth: Almost done...

Leela: Ooh, was it jazz noodling? My ex-boyfriend Sean played the sax. I used to listen for hours while he sat naked on my couch and improvised.
Bender: So musicians really Rodger your Hammerstein, huh?
Leela: Yeah, it's weird; Sean was uneducated, unambitious. He was pasty and hunched--
Fry: [quietly] Pretty boy...
Leela: But when he played I could sense this incredible, beautiful creative soul. Then one day I found someone else's couch fibers on his butt.
%
Fry: That could be my beautiful soul sitting naked on her couch. If I could just learn to play this stupid thing.

I should have revealed I've been deafened by Bender, the shame, the shame,
But I feared you'd stop writing this musical splendor,
Deception's the curse of my whimsical gender,
He gave me mechanical ears, effective though just a bit garish,
In return without shedding a tear, I agreed that I'd give him my handâ€”
Robot Devil: In marriage!
Leela: What?
Robot Devil: You'd give me your hand in marriage. [He gets down on one knee. The audience watches.]
Hermes: Is this really happening or just being staged?
Farnsworth: It can't be realâ€”
Amy: Not if Leela is engaged.
Leela: That isn't what I meant, that isn't what I signed.
Robot Devil: You should have checked the wording in my fine...Print.
Leela: "I'll give you my hand..."
Leela and Robot Devil: "In marriage."
[In the audience, Bender reads from a dictionary.]
Bender: "The use of words expressing something other than their literal intention",
Now...that...IS "irony".
[The Robot Devil pulls Preacherbot out of his seat and onto the stage.]
Robot Devil: I will marry her now and confine her to hell, how droll, how droll!
Where Styx is a river, and not just a band,
Though they'll play our reception if all goes as planned,
Unless, Fry, you surrender my hands!
[Fry looks at the hands on his wrists. The spotlight narrows over him.]
Fry: Destiny has cheated me,
By forcing me to decide upon,
The woman that I idolize,
Or the hands of an automaton,
Without these hands I can't complete,
The opera that was captivating her,
But if I keep them, and she marries him,
Then he probably won't want me dating her...
[The audience applauds and cheers.]
Richard Nixon's Head: Arooo!
Zapp Brannigan: Bray-vo! Enn-core!
Farnsworth: I can't believe the devil is so unforgiving.

Bender: I haven't felt much of anything since my guinea pig died.

Zoidberg: Who's brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere?
%
Zapp Brannigan: My god, we're defenceless. Like fish in a barrel.
Richard Nixon's Head: Options?
Zapp Brannigan: My instinct is to hide in this barrel, like the wily fish.
%
Leela: This is it. The moment we should have trained for.
%
Zapp Brannigan: Mr. President, what the hell?
%
Prof. Farnsworth: I don't like the looks of this V-GINY
%
Zapp Brannigan: I surrender and volunteer for treason!
%
Fry: Granted, all that makes perfect sense, but why is this death sphere destroying planets?
Prof. Farnsworth: That makes the most sense of all.
[Farnsworth puts up a projection of planets destroyed by the death sphere.]
Prof. Farnsworth: Look at the planets it's destroyed so far. First came XXX, the nude beach planet. Then Poopiter.
[A planet labelled "#!@â‚¬$!#%&" comes on screen.]
Prof. Farnsworth: And finally that world that can't be mentioned in polite company.
Fry: You mean...
[Fry whispers something to Farnsworth and the crew get angry at him for doing so. Farnsworth slaps Fry.]
%
Amy: I guess its time to indulge in some end-of-the-earth debauchery. Who's up for an orgy?
[Later]
Hermes: So you're saying this thing is censoring planets?
Prof. Farnsworth: Indeed. And we're next if we don't keep in in our collective pants. The only way to save Earth is to convince its citizens to repent their sinful ways.
Amy: [Wearing S&M gear] So the orgy is off?
%
[as Leela and Zapp have sex]
Fry: For God's sake! Censor it! Censor it!
V-Giny: Approved for all audiences!
Fry: Nooooo!

Leela: Come, Adam, and taste of my forbidden fruit.
Zapp Brannigan: Thee will be done.

Fry: Shut up and take my money!

Bender: This looks like a good place to ditch some evidence. [Opens bin and finds Flexo inside] Flexo! What are you doing in a hazardous waste bin?
Flexo: Didn't you hear? Us bending units are dangerously outdated. We overheat, we're radioactive, we cause erectile dysfun...[Bender closes bin]
%
Fry: That was low, Bender, even by your standards.
Bender: My what, now?
Fry: Since when is the internet about robbing people of their privacy?
Bender: August 6, 1991.

Fry: I feel like a mindless zombie. I wish I knew how long we've been waiting.

Prof. Farnsworth: Back when I was full of piss and vinegar and my bed wasn't, I fell in love with the sweetest girl ever to skip though a field of posies.
%
Bender: Ladies and gentlemen of the jury... Oops! Sorry, force of habit. I support this proposition because I'm in love with a goopy, flesh-and-blood woman, and not surprisingly, she loves me. This is a simple matter of justice, which I'm not normally for. So please, vote yes. After all, our love isn't any different than yours, except it's hotter, 'cause I'm involved.
George Takei's Head: I haven't heard a speech this eloquent since Bill Shatner told me why he couldn't pay me back.

Bender: We're gonna fight to legalize it right here!
Hermes: Ya mon! Ya got to legalize it!
Amy: We're talking about robosexual marriage.
Hermes: We're talking about lots of stuff.

Amy: Why do you have to be so mean to me?
Bender: Shut up, baby. You love it.

Bender: What?

Amy: That was great.
Bender: Shut up.

Prof. Farnsworth: My God! DaVinci's Vitruvian Man!
Fry: It's truly a masterpiece. Note how the perspective lines draw the eye right to his dong.

Prof. Farnsworth: Not distant enough! I'll be a monkey's uncle if I'm this monkey's nephew!

Prof. Farnsworth: My God! This is the greatest mystery in history. We must go to Rome and exhume the body of Saint James.
Hermes: Didn't we used to be a delivery company?

Bender: Dying sucks butt. How do you living beings cope with mortality?
Leela: Violent outbursts.
Amy: General sluttiness.
Fry: Thanks to denial, I'm immortal.
%
Bender: Anything less than immortality is a complete waste of time!
%
Fry: This is every bit as fun as the real Civil War.
Leela: Not the Civil War, Private. We're re-enacting the Sith Wars.
Fry: Sith? What the Hoth?

Darth Trocious: I shall rip out your heart and show it to you! [Taps Scruffy with toy lightsaber] It is done.

Fry: Hey, uh... What was the purpose of life, anyway?
Professor Farnsworth: Who knows? Probably some hogwash about the human spirit.
Bender: Mm-hm.
Fry: Sounds about right.
%
Farnsworth: You were late this morning. So you'll have to stay and test my latest invention.
[They walk over to a giant sheet covering something. He reveals a time travelling machine.]
Farnsworth: Behold! A time travelling machine!
[Fry and Bender gasp.]
Bender: Time? I can't go back there!
%
Farnsworth: Ah, but this time machine only goes forward in time. That way you can't accidentally change history. Or do something disgusting like sleep with your own grandmother.
Fry: I wouldn't wanna do that again.
%
Hedonism bot: Everywhere I looked there were piles of bodies. And then the explosion struck.
%
Farnsworth: I got a feeling this could be exactly the point in time we've been looking for.
[This future is entirely covered in a dead desert, covering as far as the eyes can see.]
Farnsworth: Nope.
[Farnsworth takes up a device that scans the area and turns up an X on its screen and buzzes.]
Farnsworth: In fact, all life is extinct.
%
Fry: All in all, I had a pretty sweet life. How about we grab a six pack and watch the universe end.
Bender: That's what I basically do everyday.
%
In The year 252525:
In the year 105105,
If man is still alive,
If robot can survive,
They may find...
In the year 252525,
The backwards time machine still won't have arrived.
In all the world, there's only one technology,
A rusty sword for practicing proctology!
In a future year that ends with a twenty (351120),
A shlubby merman's gonna try to get chummy.
He may look like a watery wimp,
When in fact he's a bloodthirsty shrimp!
In the year 1000000&1/2,
Humankind is enslaved by giraffe.
Man must pay for all his misdeeds,
When the treetops are stripped of their leaves!
Whoa-oh!

Nibbler: My best friend died in that uniform.

Nibbler: Can we at least know what you're doing down there?
Prof. Farnsworth: We're certainly not building anything sinster, if that's what you mean. Come on, Bender. Something sinister won't build itself.
%
Amy: Professor Katz's last name is Katz. You think he has something to do with all these cats?
Nibbler: The conclusion is as inescapable as it is moronic. It's time we paid him a visit. [Hands Amy a pistol] And if he won't listen to us, perhaps he'll listen to Smith & Wesson. [Picks up large plasma cannon] Or perhaps Consolidated Headmelter.

Amy: So you call my thesis a fat sack of barf and then stole it?
Professor Katz: Welcome to academia.

Ben Beeler: Tonight, we have a new resident here in the hall of Hominids, generously donated by its discoverer, Hubert Farnsworth. Ladies and gentlemen, Homo farnsworth.
Prof. Farnsworth: Once again, science saves the day. The end.
Ben Beeler: And now, to discuss the scientific implications of this discovery, our new museum curator, Dr. Banjo!
[Farnsworth spits out his drink]
Dr Banjo: Thank you Professor Farnsworth, for your generous gift, which has, once and for all dis-proven evolution.

Zoidberg: Don't worry, I know how to handle bullies, just pretend like you're pathetic. [Brett Blob comes towards him and Cubert] Help! I'm scared. I wet myself, I'm crying like a baby and I'm soaking in pee. But what else is new!
Brett Blob: Hahaha the pee babies peed themselves! I'm off to pottery class, dorkwads.
%
Prof. Farnsworth: As a professor of science, I assure you we did, in fact, evolve from filthy monkey-men.
%
Hermes: And here's something. [Finds a fossilized dog] Uh-oh, it's another one of Fry's dogs.
Fry: Did you say something, Hermes?
Hermes: Nothing.
%
[Zoidberg and Cubert are standing near the fossil of a long-necked reptile.]
Zoidberg: Look, Cubert. The neck on this one. I bet he spent a fortune on ties! What, too soon?
Cubert: I highly doubt a Jurassic Elaphrosaurus has access to neckwear.
Zoidberg: I knew I should have gone with the ring-around-the-collar joke.
%
Leela: Okay, we've got shelter and just enough precious food to ward off starvation.
Hermes: It's pizza time. [passes boxes to the rest of the crew.]
Amy: Ugh, pineapple?
[Everyone makes disgusted noises]
Hermes: So much for that.
%
Amy: [in Farnsworth's body] Oh no! Can we switch back using four or more bodies?

Scruffy: Ms Wong?
Washbucket: No, Scruffy, I am Washbucket. I love you. Washbucket has always loved you!
[Scruffy and Washbucket kiss, but Scruffy pulls away.]
Scruffy: It's wrong, Washbucket. Oh, it would be sweet for a while. But in the back of our minds we'd know that I'm a man, and you're janitorial equipment.
Washbucket: In another city, we could be anyone we want.
Scruffy: Go. Go now, before I beg you to stay!
[Washbucket leaves]
Scruffy: [Sobs, then suddenly stops] Ayup.

Amy: I wasted my youth porking out.
Farnsworth: Yes, I remember. [He points to a picture of a fat Amy, captioned "2997 employee of the year".]
Amy: Would you please take that down? It's making me hungry.
%
Fry: So Leela's all crotchety because she thinks I don't like her in the Professor's disgusting body.
Hermes: You do, don't you?
Fry: Of course, but I was willing to lie about it. What more can a man do?
Hermes: You could switch your mind into a gross, disgusting body, give her a toke of her own medicine.
Fry: Of course! But it would have to be a really disgusting body.
Zoidberg': Friends, look! I have barnacles in my tuchus! [Opens his trousers to reveal barnacles on his buttocks]

Matt Groening's Head: Boy, Fox has really streamlined the process.

Leela: Oh, Mom, Dad, I can't believe I have to spend the rest of my life in this hellhole. [She pauses as her parents look shocked.] I'm sorry.
Turanga Munda: It's okay, sweetie. Now that you're here, this hellhole feels more like a nice, regular hole.
Turanga Morris: What do ya say we go get some sewer coffee, sewer cake, and Safeway ice cream?
%
Fry: I'm so sorry I ratted you out, but, you know, after two weeks down here, I'll truly understand the plight of the mutant people.
Leela: How dare you? You wanna understand something? Look at that lake. One dip in that toxic muck and your DNA will be permanently mutated. You'll grow a camel hump or a Zoidberg face.
Zoidberg: Urgh!
%
Amy: Something's wrong. It's way too quiet.
Fry: Like the deadly Prius.

Amy: Oh no! This could be the year without a Kwanza, like every year before 1966.

Zoidberg: What's that loud, boring sound you'll hear when I stop talking?
Prof. Farnsworth: [gasps] It's an albino humping worm!
Fry: Why do they call it that?
[The ship begins to rock back and forth]
Prof. Farnsworth: Because it doesn't have any pigment.

Dick Cheney's Head: As your Vice President, I order you to steal that tree.

Bender: Do you not give a damn about the hallowed traditions of Robanukah?!
Hoschel: I reckon I do not. Anyways, Earth done run out of petroleum oil.
Al Gore's Head: I tried to warn you. [to Hoschel] One unit of free limitless solar power please.
[Hoschel steps out of the sun. He smiles when it reaches full power.]
Hoschel: That'll be... I dunno... ten bucks?
Al Gore's Head: Um, can you make change for a Nobel Prize?
%
Fry: Can someone please explain how you celebrate this crazy holiday? Preferably in song?
Robot Santa: [singing] It's the violentest season of the year.
Elf: Old Kringle-bot has come to spread some mugs of Xmas fear.
Robot Santa: Sugar-plummy visions will be dancing in your head
When I cane you from the comfort of my sled.
Leela: On Xmas Eve, we don our gay apparel,
Kevlar vests, asbestos stockings and a barrel.
Prof. Farnsworth': And if Grandma's Xmas fruitcake finally reaches critical mass,
It can be re-gifted straight to Santa's ass.
Robot Santa: But the ornamental armaments are merely superficial,
The tinsel and the trappings are just icing on the missile.
The one thing that you need to make your Xmas day splendiferous
Is a pine tree; a pine tree that's coniferous.
Planet Express crew: We have to have a pine tree as coniferous.
Robot Santa: [flies away] You're welcome.
%
Bender: I've placed instruments under your seats. Play 'em or I'll break 'em over your heads!
[Fry gets out a holophonor; the Professor, a fiddle; and Dr. Zoidberg, an accordion, and start playing klezmer music.]
Bender': [singing] Robanukah may sound as if it's Jewish,
But its ancient sounding customs are exceptionally newish.
So take a hearty swallow from your robo-kiddish cup,
Which will give me time to quickly make them up.
Hermes: Do you spin a dreidel made from clay?
Bender': Mine is called a droidel and it's rigged to make you pay.
Amy: Do you eat these yummy tin-wrapped chocolate coins?
Bender': Better!
We got fembots with illegal five-speed groins!
Shalom, Ruth and Esther!
Ruth: Why with the music so loud?
Esther: Would it kill him to turn up the heat a little in here?
Bender': But by far the most important thing is oil.
Leela: To keep the lamp light burning or to help the latkes broil?
Bender': No, we pour the holy lubricant out from the sacred vessel
Into this blessed pit so they can wrestle.
Planet Express crew: The extra made-up touch that makes Robanukah so special
Is the oil in which the nasty fembots wrestle.

My favorite's ujamaa.
Bubblegum Tate: Cooperative economics.
Kwanzaa-bot: [to Dwight] Yo, boondocks, I'm talkin' here! Put away the comics!
Ku'umba is another one, it stands for creativity.
Barbados Slim: Like the ever-changing nature of my sexual proclivities. [starts coming on to Zoidberg]
Kwanzaa-bot: I think there's one called "nia," but I don't speak Swahili,
Sumthin' 'bout a pine tree and a oil-wrestlin' dealy?
Prof. Farnsworth: That's from Xmas and Robanukah, you plagiarizing lout!
Kwanzaa-bot: Yeah, I'm kinda losin' interest here. I'd best be rollin' out.
But before I go, the most important thing...
Dwight: What's that, Black Santa?
Kwanzaa-bot: You need seven Kwanzaa candles that you light up every night.
But they best be made of beeswax or y'all might as well be white.
Planet Express crew: [writing on notepads] They must be made of beeswax or we might as well be white.

Prosecutor: Isn't it true, Mr. X, that you are slandering this innocent mafioso to distract from your own felonious past, including the crime you made up yourself called burglararsonlarsony?
Bender: That's a wholly owned trademark of Rodriguez Crime Concepts Inc.! Besides, I'm not on trial here.
Judge 724: That's true. You're on trial in courtroom 3. [presses button, wall spins Bender to another courtroom with a female version of 724]

Zoidberg: His only hope is some replacement liver. Yours looks like a good match.
Leela: Well, if it'll help Fry...
Fry: Careful, Leela. He knows less about human anatomy than I do, and I can't even find my own uterus.

Fry: Oh, sure. Leela's fine. But my jaundice has progressed to Muppet Gangrene. It's not easy being gangrenous.

Leela: It wasn't unavoidable! You just had to stop cutting my spine when I yelled, "Stop! You're cutting my spine!"
Fry: Stop complaining. My body rejected your liver and now I have Garfield Syndrome. I hate Mondays.

Fry: Oh, it's just that I love Leela something awful. Do you think a space dame like her would ever marry a two-bit low-life delivery boy like me? And also, I have bad posture some severe financial problems?
Bender: Have you tried gettin' her pregnant?
Fry: Gosh, yes! I've tried and tried! But, so far, I only got Amy pregnant.

Prof. Farnsworth: Apparently so. Wait! There's a snail on the tail of the frog on the bump on this log that I found in a hole on the bottom of the sea. The snail itself is composed of cells, molecules, atoms...
Fry: Pfff! Those things don't rhyme!
Prof. Farnsworth: Things only rhyme below ten to the minus five angstroms, you dope!

Zoidberg: Here my words. My shell may be tough like a samurai honeymoon mask, but inside I'm as soft and sensitive as a girl made of custard.
Cubert: Custard Time?! Hooray!

Prof. Farnsworth: Of course! Having no mouths or ears they can only communicate through motions!

Leela: I knew it! I knew he'd get us killed somehow!

Ben Beeler: Using my fancy technology, I can make an exact copy of this guitar.
