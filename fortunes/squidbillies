Therapist: Alright, look. I want you to take all those things that are eating 
away, weighing you down inside, and I want you to pull them all out... and 
scream them out at the top of your lungs. Sheriff?
Sheriff: Who, me?
Therapist: Yeah, just cut loose. I mean, just get it all off your chest. This 
is a safe haven for both of you gentlemen.
Sheriff: Okay. (Shuffles to edge of cliff) Well, you see... Early... well, he 
don't respect...
Early: Are you done? Everybody stand back, it's my turn.
Sheriff: No...
Early: Nyuh huh, I just called it. (Begins to nudge the Sheriff out of the way)
Sheriff: (Kicks Early away) Don't you push me! You always push me into 
positions I don't like! I'm the law! And you break the law and you still expect 
me to be your friend? How can I be who I am and still be in a relationship with 
you! It's always about you! You think you're the center of the universe and we 
all...
[Cut to several hours later, sunset]
Sheriff: ...moved the show to Friday, head-to-head with CSI? Come on! You've 
got to give a show time to find an audience...
[Cut to several hours later, night has fallen]
Sheriff: ...hell, you know he can act! He played Doogie Howser for seven 
seasons!
Therapist: (Claps) Excellent work gentlemen, excellent. (Looks at watch, begins 
to back away) Hey, ah, I think this is about as good as it gets, guys...
Sheriff: Naw! Naw! Without us they have no network...
[Cut to serveral hours later, sunrise]
Sheriff: ...often wondered if I even do have a pair! Yes, of testicles! (Grabs 
crotch) I've never seen them, no! And you dressed me in chiffon! Pretty, pretty 
chiffon! Well, guess what! I think I'm pregnant... again! Thanks a lot, mama! 
(Whips off shirt and throws it off the cliff) Whew, well, that felt pretty good.
%
Therapist: (Begins to back away) I, I really need to, um, sorta wrap this thing 
up.
Early: Wait a minute! Ain't I gonna get to yell nothin'?
Therapist: Well, (sighs) sure Early... go ahead.
Early: Whoo! Gimme back my bullets! Ooh, that smell! What the hell is that 
smell? (Holds up lighter) Whoo!
Therapist: Well, um... do you have any concerns of not really a Skynyrd-deep 
cut?
Early: Uh, yeah, something has been kinda gnawing at me. Stand back. (Yells off 
cliff) Show me them titties!
Sheriff: Are you talkin' to my mama?
Early: If she'll do it! Will she do it?
%
Therapist: I'm not a therapist. I'm The Rapist.
%
Granny: Don't you dare hurt him!

[the walls of the house open up and Earlie is struck by lightning]
Early: You lucky bitch! That was the one thing you coulda said.
Granny: Yeah Okay.
%
Early: Fruit don't talk, fruit just listens... and waits. Granny[after being 
shot by Rusty}: Jesus! I've been filled by your spirit! Oh no wait a minute I

Granny: Aaaah! A Talkin' honeydew! It's the apocalypse!" Early: "I'm bout ta

Early: Oh Lord who done made all creatures great and small in his own image:

than hell comin' out of the back of my truck-boat-truck? Well if you don't want 
me to jimmy-jack 'em sweet tweeters you best give me a sign...
(Early rips off a sticker reading "EARLY CUYLER / DO NOT TOUCH!")
Early: A new sign - I done seen that'n.
%
(Early awakens from a coma to the sound of a life support machine. He opens his 
eyes to see his son Rusty standing over him saying "Boop... boop... boop...")
Rusty: Y'all hear that? That's what it'd sound like if we had insurance.
%
Early: Yes granny - I seen the light. Like a DUI roadblock in the sky. But I 
pulled a U-ie and hauled ass through the woods! And now my life has purpose. 
Goodbye party liquor! Gunnery, you have a good'un! Masturbation... uh... let's 
just call it a hiatus. From now on, I am a bushhog on the front-end loader of 
the Lord!
%
Early: (In a strip club) Yes darlin', your chest is full and heaving. But what

religious tract)... I want you to read this here literature.
%
Early: Nope! Pick it up with your butt cheeks!
%
Granny: Will you keep it down for cryin' out loud? I'm trying to watch my

really hard time. Stories?
Early: Nuh-uh. I done give away the story box. From now on we gonna enjoy this 
classic butter churn. (Begins churning)
Granny: (Looks around) Oh where's the TV? 'Cause now I'm pissed.
Early: Come on now, everybody take a turn! Idle hands is the devil's 
ding-a-ling!
%
Early: I'll be here for 40 days and 40 nights if thats what it takes to keep 
these commandments on display! What's next, they're goin' to try to take it out 
of our schools? Bullmess! I am against it!
(Shows Early later in the same place)
Early: I'm against mens kissin mens, for any reason, but when womerns do it...

out with another woman...

Early Cuyler and this concludes my court-ordered community service.

the kids of Six Pack, ain't it?
Sheriff: 1982! The coward of the county's own self stood right here!
%
Sheriff: Stone Mountain. World's most appropriately named mountain in the South 
East. And look carved there on the side, the four horseman of the confederacy. 
Stonewall Jackson, Robert E. Lee, Jefferson Davis, and Pacman!

weren't for Pacman, we might'a lost the damn war!

JudgeÂ : "Counselour approach the bench...your lookin' at an uphill battle

years I gotta wait? I want me the greatest gift of all!
Santa: I won't bring you the still-beating heart of Jeff Gordon! All right? 
I've said it!
Early: Well...Nicholas, I'm disappointed. We'll do it this way--Russell, get me

while Mild watches helpless because that's what gets him off.

do nuthin' for it.
Satan: Listen to the little whiny bitch. Boy, he's really gonna hate it when he 
gets to Hell.
Rusty: I don't wanna go to hell! Come on, do something, Daddy!
Satan: You know, it's actually not much worse than your current situation. I 
mean, yeah, we have really high taxes, but hey, you earn real money at least. I 
mean, we do have jobs down there. It's not everything you hear.
Rusty: Oh, really?
Satan: Hahaha, no! You are raped by fire all day! And the days are longer down 
there! Oh, there's plenty to drink. You know what you drink? FIRE, 
motherstuffer, that's what! Dinner? That's a root that makes you thirsty for 
more flippin' fire! You understand? It's ridiculous what I've set up down there!
%
Rusty: Oh my God! It's Ridley Scott's "Alien"! Look at it! Oh my God! Oh my God!

Santa: Okay, this is Big Crimson Daddy. Stop production on all sex toys 
immediately.
Elf: We're... everything?

vibrators.

Santa: No... yes. Yes, we can make that work. I'll call Sharper Image.
Elf 3: What about these, Santa?
Santa: The Kalishnakovs? With the Drum-Triber air sight and the fixed stock... 
oh, God, that's a nice weapon... uh... let me hold off on that one.
%
Dan Halen: I have to say it was all worth it! Screw every last one of you!

Reverend: Who even cares? Life is merely a fantasy draped in confusion. The 
curtain is yanked back from the charade!
Early: Would you grab my skull bong, from the reverend please?
%
Melissa: We caught up with Halen in his inground pool, inexplicably built in 
the middle of a giant lake, which is itself a giant aboveground pool.
%
Melissa: Mr. Halen, take a look at this. (Turns on TV showing a police riot) 
The Chicago Democratic Convention in 1968.
Dan Halen: Ah, the '60s. I'll never forget them.
Melissa: I believe that's you in the upper-left corner hitting someone with a 
chain.
Dan Halen: (laughing) I remem-- I remember I made that guy taste the chain. 
"Taste the chain," I said again and again, long after he was incapable of 
tasting anything.
Melissa: We found this in the archives after the invasion of Poland. (Plays 
stock footage of Halen alongside Adolf Hitler, saluting in full uniform and 
shouting, "Heil Hitler! Sieg Heil!")
Dan Halen: We belonged to the same gym. I suppose you'll take that image out of 
context and make it into something.
Melissa: Here you are in Berlin in 1926.
Dan Halen: So I used to be a transvestite cabaret host. You have a point with 
this?
Melissa: According to our research, Dan Halen has apparently existed throughout 
recorded history.
Dan Halen: (against a montage featuring him in a direct capacity, starting 
with...) Everyone tortured political prisoners during the medieval era. (Atop a 
Mayan pyramid, pulling out a heart) This sacrifice led to plenty of rain. The 
maize crop that year was wonderful. (At the feet of the Crucifixion, wooden 
hammer in hand) I was taking the nail out. I was trying to help the man. (Cave 
painting of a body struck by three arrows and Halen with lit torch, dragging 
woman by the hair) Well, it's not like I invented fire. (As a monk holding a 
rat over a body) So I spread some of the Black Plague. (Whipping Egyptian 
slaves) Those Egyptians were trying to steal precious artifacts from the 
British museum. (Atop a unicorn, close to a Tyrannosaurus) Well, that-- that 
was just an accident.
Melissa: Mr. Halen, these pictures prove you're tens of thousands of years old.
Dan Halen: Melissa...
Melissa: What do you say to these charges?
Dan Halen: I don't recall.
Melissa: You don't recall that you're a living embodiment of evil?
Dan Halen: Uh, no. No, I don't recall that.
Melissa: A plague on humanity from the beginning of time?
Dan Halen: Mmm...no. No, I don't recall.
Melissa: We have film evidence. We have pictures.
Dan Halen: Come on!
Melissa: What could you possibly say to these charges, Mr. Halen?
Dan Halen: I'm sorry, but I'm not equipped to reach a conclusion regarding that 
assessment at this time. And what's more, let me add that I will explode your 
head for saying that.
Melissa: Mr. Hal... (Her head explodes)
Dan Halen: Yes, there's no such thing as a free necklace, muckraker.
%
Dan Halen: I should have put it together. The copious references to "Nature 
Boy" Ric Flair and former Black Crowes bassist Johnny Colt. Hell, Halen,
