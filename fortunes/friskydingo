[The title sequence from Sealab 2021 plays, but is cut in by Killface.]
Killface: Greetings America! I . . . am . . . Killface. Don't bother flicking 
your infernal remotes, I've taken over your airwaves. Now, I trust you're all 
comfy on your tacky sofas from Rooms-to-Go, lots of nibbles close at hand? 
Well, tuck in! And why not smoke between gobbles? Yes, go for the gusto 
America! Live like there's no tomorrow, because as far as you squallid lot are 
concerned, there very much isn't . . . . Behold! [camera switches views to a 
large contraption] The instrument of your doom! I call it: The Annihilatrix! 
And when it is completed, a million gigatons of thrust will propel the Earth, 
directly, into the Sun. So look upon my works ye mighty, and despair.....
%
Killface: And we're happy with this background?
[Dissention from the others]
Killface: It's not too Leno-y?
Trent: [enraged] If you want to be Leno-y, we can have you come down here, and 
you can do high fives! We could put a wig with a gray streak in your face! We 
can have you read off cuecards! We'll put Kevin Eubanks over there on guitar! 
[calms down] I shouldn't have said that.
[Killface shoots Trent, sending his severed upper body across the room.]
Brent: That was my twin brother!
Killface: [points the gun at the other two] I want it to be perfect.
%
Killface: Maybe we should ask Trent.
[Killface picks up Trent's severed torso like a ventriliquist's dummy]
Killface: So uh.. heard you went to the doctor and uh... he had a bit of bad 
news for you, is that right?
Killface: [moving Trent's mouth and imitating his voice] Yeah! Turns out I have 
termites.
[Killface turns to the others and smiles]
%
Killface: There's your twenty billion, Brent! Drink it in! The fusion chamber 
alone cost nine billion. The thrusters another four! You think there's just 
heaps of money left over for - WHAT DID YOU CALL IT?
Brent: Uh [clears throat] Media Buy.
Killface: MEDIA BUY!?!
Valerie: Please don't kill us!
Killface: Please don't make it so appealing!
%
[Killface is holding Brent by his legs at the top of the Annihilatrix, 
threatening to drop him]
Killface: [sighs] You see, Brent? We all have jobs to do.
Brent: Great, there goes my pen! Great!
Killface: My job is to complete the Annihilatrix and destroy mankind by driving 
this vile planet straight into the Sun [Brent interrupts].
Brent: Wait! I have another idea! Listen...
Killface: And your job is to market it.
Brent: Listen! No listen! We can get... Jason Alexander!
Killface: Great!
Brent: Yeah!
Killface: You can call him when you hit the ground!
Brent: Nooo! Wait, wait! I got another idea! Better than Jason Alexander! I 
got, uh...
Killface: Don't say David Arquette to me!
Brent: I wo... well now that you say that I'm not going to.

[Killface is examining Annihilatrix DVD]
Brent: ...Any standard DVD player.
Killface: Or any uhh... "PC", it says here?
Brent: Yes, any Personal Computer with DVD capabiliti-
Killface: GREAT SCOTT!!
Valerie: [Screams out in panic]
Brent: What?
Killface: [Laughs], "PC"...
Brent: What?
Killface: ...Stands for "Personal Computer"... I just this moment got that... 
VALERIE!!!
Valerie: [Screams in panic again]
Killface: It's alright if you want to laugh.
[All three are silent]
Valerie: [Nervous laugh]
Killface: Good girl.
%
Brent: [to Killface] You fucking kidnap us, right, you drag us up here, ya shit 
on every strategy we come up with - and by the way, that web promotion was 
tiiiiiight, but the bottom line is, you don’t have the fucking budget to run 
with the big dogs! Now, do you! (begins making barking noises).
Killface: [scoffs] Are you finished?
Brent: Yeah. Yeah, I'm sorry
[Kills Brent the same way he killed Trent]
Killface: Look, Trent. I've made you a playmate. Say "Hello". Good lad.
%
Killface: [calling out] Sinn!
[Sinn enters the room]
Killface: If you would, please draw a bath for our lovely guest here. And 
please get this place decorpsed
%
Killface: [to Simon] We can't ever go back to Arizona!
%
Killface: [watching Taqu'il on TV], Can't watch tellie for five seconds without 
seeing that jibbering hooligan and here I am reduced to ... post cards, the dry 
hump of marketing strategies.
%
Stan: It's time you learned how to run a business, and the first thing you're 
gonna do is fire the Xtacles.
Xander: But the Xtacles are the backbone of the Awesome-X fighting force.
Stan: They're also a $5 million annual drain on the company's bottom line.
Xander: Is that all you care about, the bottom line?
Stan: Yes.
Xander: Well, unless we all of a sudden lose $5 million somehow, I'm not firing 
my dogs... and I have to go ride in my limo.
%
[Grace Ryan is approaching the room where Xander is sleeping with a hooker.]
Grace: [opens door] What are you doing here?
Xander: [has put on the Awesome-X mask] Xan-uh, Billy- Xander Crews said I 
could use his place for this...
Grace: He-
Xander: ...hooker.
Grace: You know him?
Xander: We went to college together - no we didn't - get out of here. He will 
meet you at your place in an hour.
%
Hooker: Oh my God
Xander: I did not mean for her to see this
Hooker: Xander Crews
Xander: Lets go back to the big black thing.
Hooker: You're Awesome-X!
%
Stan: Five million dollars?!
Xander: Well, I had to pay her off. I can't have some blabbity-mouth hooker 
running around with my secret identity! That's the first thing they teach you.
Stan: Nobody cares about your secret identity!
Xander: It's to protect my loved ones.
Stan: You don't have any loved ones!
Xander: [gasp] Stan!
Stan: What, who? That girlfriend you treat like dirt? Your murdered parents?
[Quick shot of pictures of Xander's parents]
Stan: And you can say good-bye to the X-tacles.
Xander: Wh--What?
Stan: What what? You just spent their entire salary for the year.
Xander: See, I knew you were going to trick me into doing this!
Stan: Me?! You're the one who paid five million dollars for a blowjob!
Xander: I...it was a half-and-half, first of all; second of all...okay I'm 
going.
%
[Xander, as Awesome-X, has a conversation with the Xtacles.]
Xander: ...but the Crew Company funds the entire Awesome X operation. So, you 
know, take it up with Xander Crews.
Xtacle #1: Let's kill that son of a bitch!
Xtacles: Yeah!
Xander: No, no, let's don't--he's a good guy. We don't kill good guys. We kill 
bad guys, come on. It's in our charter
Xtacle #1: So, what's up with our 401(k)?
[Xander just turns his head and groans]
Xtacle #2: What--that's my nest egg! We're still gonna have health insurance, 
right?
Xtacle #1: Oh my God! Health insurance, I need that.
[Xander just clears his throat]
Xtacles: What?!
Xtacle #3: Are we at least eligible for COBRA?
Xander: What, the little... the G. I. Joe dolls?
Xtacle #2: No, not the G. I. Joe dolls.
%
Xander: I don't care what "Boys from Brazil" thing you got going on in there, 
but I'm still the boss in here. And we're making Awesome-X dolls, and they're 
gonna kick so much ass, you'll probably go blind. And if you still have a 
problem with that, there's the big-ass door.
Stan: You're not going to sell doll one without a villain, you ninny--a Cobra 
to your G. I. Joe; a Stretch Monster to your Stretch Armstrong; a Decepticon to 
your Autobot!
%
Xander: Hey! Tone, of Voice
%
Stan: 250 years, this company's been in your family, and from slaves and 
smallpox blankets, to softcore porn and semiconductors, it's always made a 
profit; but with one fell idiotic swoop, you've ruined it. I'm just glad your 
murdered parents...
Xander: My murdered parents wanted me to be happy!
[Quick shot of parents' pictures, with Awesome-X doll head]
Xander: And this can make me happy, Stan: [crying a little] fiscal sales of 
Awesome-X dolls.
Stan: No one is going to buy a superhero doll without a villain to fight.
Xander: Then I'm kind of...at a loss, unless--[holds up Killface's postcard] 
what about this guy for the villain?
Stan: What? When did this get here?
Xander: Uhh... apparently, it's been here the whole time.

[a scene from Taqu'il's latest movie Some Like It Crump begins with police 
sirens resounding as Taqu'il's character is lying in the backseat clutching his 
side, clearly bleeding from a gunshot wound]
Taqu'il [as Jimmy] Ahh.. Ah! Ah! I can't... believe that bitch shot me! You 
gotta take me to the hospital!
[the view changes to reveal the driver of the car, a black man, dressed as a 
clown in a clown suit and makeup, complete with rainbow wig and red nose]
Clown: [turning to speak to Jimmy as he is driving] You know I can't do that, 
Jimmy! You ain't gonna die. Say it!
Jimmy: I'm all shot up, man!
Clown: You ain't gonna diiiiieeeeee, say the freakin' woooooorrrrrds! [a 
smaller clown seated on the passenger side appears and honks a horn at him]
Jimmy: I ain't gonna die... I ain't gonna die... I ain't gonna die.

Sinn: If he always throws his food on the floor, how is he so fat?
Simon: [gasps and runs off]
Killface: No, son... [to Sinn] Now look what you've done!
Sinn: Sire, I'm sorry
Killface: Apologize to his self-esteem! Now we've talked about the chubby 
cycle. One snarky comment like that and he's back in the cupboard. And he was 
doing so well. Three pounds this week.
Sinn: Yes sire.
Killface: Shut up. Just shut up and eat the cereal.
Sinn: It's got glass in it.

Taqu'il: Cameraman, cameraman, can you push in on this? It says "Welcome to 
you-apostraphe-r-e doom"?
Verl: And he's got "doom" in quotes, which it shouldn't be.
Mitzi: Oh I just hate it when people do that. I just want to throw acid in 
their face.
%
Killface: Why does it say "Welcome to you're 'Doom!'"? What does that even 
mean, and why, for God's sakes, is "Doom!" in quotes?
Valerie: I don't know.
Killface: Is this some sort of ironic doom? Is the wink implied?
Valerie: No, I don't know.
Killface: No, it isn't. So please tell me how and why I'm suddenly a 
laughingstock!
Valerie: Uh...'cause you signed off on the proofs?
[Killface just taps the postcard on his thigh]
%
Killface: [on climbing machine] ...then find me that printer so I can cut his 
arms off.
Valerie: But you signed off on...
Killface: Mention those proofs again and just see what happens, Valerie.
Valerie: Look, bad grammar aside, forty million people just saw your postcard.
Killface: [stopping exercise] Bugger me! They pull those numbers?
Valerie: It's the highest-rated daytime show ever.
Killface: Ugh, I hate America.
Valerie: [leading] And their booker owes me a favor.
Killface: No, she doesn't. Valerie, if you could get me on Live With Mitzi and 
Verl, I'd...I'd want two segments--not the one after Verl monologue, that's 
garbage time--but the next two, after the break. Valerie, you get me on there, 
you just name your reward.
Valerie: I'd like for you to let me go.
Killface: [resuming exercise] Well, you know...except for that.

Mitzi: "Big guy" is right. Look at those pecs! [Applause] I wish I had a chest 
like that. Ba-dum-bum!

like her growing up.
X-tacle #2: Dude, save it for group.

Verl: Big guy, how much ya bench?
Killface: I don't know, really...
Verl: I bet you do 240.

Verl: 900 pounds this guy...
Killface: No, no, sorry that's kilos.

Randy: Introducing the Scion tC! The bold, sleek styling is all like ka-kow, 
but the 2.4-liter dual overhead cam engine with 160-horsepower is all like 
KA-KOW!

Mao: [watching in store] Sci-ron t-She!

Verl: Everybody look under your seats!
Killface: Stop it! [silence] First of all, Oprah already gave her audience 
cars...
Verl: Not the new Scion tC, she didn't!
Killface: ...and didn't waste one segment clucking like a goose about that damn 
ring--and I hope you know a good appraiser, because if that's not paste, I'll 
eat my hat. [Mitzi gasps] Now my last segment has fallen victim to "Scion 
fever."
Verl: Because we love the new Scion tC!
Killface: Shut up! There's a clear line between entertainment and advertising, 
and you've bloody well crossed it.
[The Scion tC is featured is the background while he talks.]
Killface: Those 18-24's that you're so keen on detest being pitched to, and 
when I destroy the world, they won't have much use for 17-inch alloy wheels, 
so...no, no, turn that off there. Stop it. I won't be your pitchman. You hear 
me. [Walking off; petulant] You're all doomed.
Verl: Doomed to enjoy the new Scion tC!
%
Killface: What a colossal waste of time, and I defy this day to get any worse.
Guy #1: [out of shot] Hey, there goes the new Scion tC!
Guy #2: Dude, that is tight!
Killface: I hate this country.
X-tacles: [driving by in Scion tC, splashing puddle all over Killface] Scion 
tC! Scion tC!

sun!

Awesome X: Just a damn minute, Mr. man, are you even Asian?

Mao: Yeah, see, I kinda got this minority business loan.

Xtacle #2: Or maybe open up a beauty salon.

Mao: Hey. Hey, whoa. Can't we work something out here. [slips him a postcard]
Xander: More. More. More, like a whole box more. And the villabouts of the

Sinn: Perhaps you could get something for it at the local pawnbrokery.

really really really really really really really smart! [Pause] And pretty.

Watley:Yeah, cause I'm not... getting... raped.

Phil: Sir, don't you think it's kind of weird how the prize money for this 
thing is exactly the amount we need to finish the Annihilatrix?
Killface: No, I think it's weird that you question me every...time there's 
a...thing.

Killface: Sinn, meet Mr Watley. But don't get too friendly. I'm afraid he's one 
of our competitors.
Sinn: Charmed

Watley: [strains as a plopping sound is heard]

Watley: Well, I gotta go. You should get those in some sand. [runs off 
embarassed]

Now look, I'm counting on all of you. There's no yesterday. There's no 
tomorrow. Forget ant farm keyboard. That's... forget that. I want you to go out 
there, and take this moment, and make it yours.

school hear about this.

radioactive waste can also go.

Cameraman: No, we don't.

Xander: Looking back, Operation Snooperfax was a little...convoluted. 
Convoluted.
Stan: Convoluted? Damn it, you just about used up all of our operating capital.
Xander: Do we still have enough to pay for Train Island?
Stan: Yes, your little choo-choos are safe.
Xander: Nice!
Stan: Only because I had to make some pretty deep cuts in...elsewhere.

X-tacle #1: Guess I'll call Jan and tell her we're not going to Orlando.
X-tacle #2: Orlando? Dude, this won't even cover my mortgage.

Watley: And I'll put the ant-farm keyboards in the radioactive waste, thereby 
minimizing the ecological impacts of both! Way to go Watley, you're doin it!

storm?

Cameraman: Has it got Bluetube on it?
Killface: No, you big, sloppy man. I just want "Cat Party."

your face's house.

Sinn: You didn't kill the taxi driver?

Killface: Well then. [Shoots the taxi driver] London calling.
Grace: Oh my God! Yes! THAT is exactly the kind of bloodlust that makes for a 
phenomenal interview. Hi. Grace Ryan, Force 10 News.
Killface: And you must be Killface. What am I saying? Of course you're not 
Killface, not with a face like that; no one in their right mind would think to 
call you...I'm Killface...if anybody is.

Killface: [to Simon] I'm so proud of you. We're going to split a half-pint of 
lager and watch Cinemax all night.

Xander: Grace!
Waiter: Mi amor!
Killface: Lovely newslady!
Grace: This is Grace Ryan, Force 10 News, dangling helplessly from high atop 
the Annihilatrix, my microphone now literally a lifeline, because if I fall, I 
will drop into...what appear to be drums full of super-intelligent 
radioactive-waste-covered ants.
Cameraman: [whispering] Oh God, please fall.

everyone just stares looking down]

Grace: Don't you dare hurt him!

Killface: Phil, given your strict forcemeats-and-cheese regimen, the only real 
surprise is you're not dead already.
Phil: Phil, grappling with the cold reality of death, has no pithy rejoinder.

Grace: Oh my God, Xander, where are you?
Killface: Well, wherever he is, I'm sure he's laughing his fat face off.

Phil: Enh!
Killface: Surely this town has a Y, Philip?
Phil: No, I'm getting a pretty nice Healing Vibe here. Good for my Chakra.

Prawn and...whatever happend to Val?

Phil: You know, from here it looks like ants are robbing that bank.

luffa.

Crews and damn his snotty back!

pounding the machine again, breaking it] But now this blasted machine tells me 
my checking account can't be accessed!!

School...
Nearl: Everybody!
X-tacle #2: ...and slow dance to Lisa Lisa and motherf*cking Cult Jam!
Nearl: Lisa Lisa, the one I adore!

Stan: What are "whammies"?

Nearl: Summer, 1977. Queen's "Bohemian Rhapsody" was playing on Everybody's 
Eight-Track as the nation slept in fear of the Son-of-Sam killer [X-Tacle's 
Gasp], and mourned the loss of our Favourite Son, legendary rock-and-roll icon 
Elvis Aaron Pres-
[An X-Tacle's Head Explodes]:
X-Tacle #1: Why are our heads still blowing up?
X-Tacle #2: Sorry. Sat on the remote.
X-Tacle #3: We should put that in a cabinet...
X-Tacle #2: Yeah.
Nearl: [continuing his story] And...
X-Tacle #3:That your fat ass can't fit in.
Nearl: Everybody! Just...Okay? And, Like Elvis, Xander Crews had...an identical 
twin! [X-Tacles Gasp]
X-Tacle #3: A twin?
Nearl: Twin Heirs, to the vast Crews Fortune, left behind by my murdered 
Parents. (shows them an identical photo to Xander's)
X-Tacle #1: Oh my God.
X-Tacle #2: [Referring to his Popcorn] Yeah, it's Cheddar.

Young Nearl: I don't wanna go to the monkey hospital!
Young Xander: But Nearl wanna stay with mummy and daddy and brother Xandy!
Mrs Crews: No Xander, he's dead to us
Young Xander: (Starts crying)
Mr Crews: Now; who's for Denny's?
Young Xander: (Instantly stops crying) Grandslam!
%
X-Tacle #1: Oh My God I'm so friggin' sad!
Nearl: Yes! Here you go. [Hands X-Tacle a tissue]
X-Tacle #1: I'll take it thank you.
Nearl: But life in the hospital was a Picnic compared to Life on the Mean 
streets of...Town...
[Flashback]:
Nearl: ...But I want to stay forever living in the Hospital with you Mr. Ford!
Mr. Ford: Hospital closed Nearl.
Nearl: Uh Oh!
Mr. Ford: Now I gotta go and work in a damn Pet Store.
Nearl: I'd like that!
Mr. Ford: [Ignoring him] And you can thank Ron Reagan's ass for that! (He 
drives away)
Nearl: Thank you, Ronald Reagan. (Pauses to think) Your legacy is intact.
[Flashback Ends]:
Nearl: But thanks to you and your mysterious brain chemical, we shall savor the 
sweet nectar of revenge as we rise up, as one man, and DESTROY MY BROTHER, 
XANDER CREW--[Ronnie shoots Nearl in the head] Thanks, Ken! [Nearl falls over]
X-tacle #1: Ronnie!
Ronnie: What?
X-tacle #1: What is wrong with you!?
Ronnie: Hey, what? I do you favor.
X-tacle #1: This is why we can't have nice things! Thank you, Ronnie!
Ronnie: Look this is complicated enough without all this evil twin bullsh*t 
having.
X-tacle #1: You know, that is... actually, that's a pretty good point.
X-tacle #2: Good for you, Ronnie.
X-tacle #1: Yeah, it's complicated.
X-tacle #3: So, if Xander Crews really is Awesome X, then where is he?
%
[a fellow slave has given Killface a radish]
Killface: Barnaby, tell him thank you. [Xander Crews thanks him in a foreign 
language] Try to make it sound a little sarcastic.
%
Killface: Well, a train's not an iron rooster but that's what they call it in 
China!
Xander Crews: Really?
Old Spice: [Laughs, speaks in chinese] It's a colorful language.
%
Xander Crews: Oh, that's just crazy China man talk.
Killface: Barnaby, make those words English!
Xander Crews: I kinda think he said... death rabbits.

["Previously" on "Frisky Dingo"]
Sinn: I can't believe Killface fired me. Well, revenge shall be mine.
Valerie: [kicking out the painting] No! Revenge shall be mine!

X-tacle #1: I can't believe Xander Crews had a twin brother!
X-tacle #2: Yeah, until Ronnie shot him in the face.
%
X-tacle #1: Has anyone got a prayer?
X-tacle #2: Oh! Uh... It's more of a limerick."
%
X-tacle #2: There once was a dead guy named Nearl. He rode around town on a 
squirrel. He said to the pig... I... don't actually have one.
X-tacle #1: Fantastic.
%
Killface: So if I'm here... this way... oh, here's an idea, indicate north. 
Otherwise it's not a map. It's just a drawing.
Xander Crews: So get this, he didn't even have a car.
Killface: Well thank God we sorted that out.
Xander Crews: Yeah.
Killface: Now will you please come on!
%
X-tacle #1: Come on, no sense mopin' around here all day.
Ronnie: Yes, have too many sad memories here. [Knocks over Nearl's wreath.] 
Also is messy.

X-tacle #3: Oh...my...god!
X-tacle #2: What?
X-tacle #3: Let's get there this instant!
%
Killface: Barnaby, listen.
Xander Crews: What?
Killface: I thought I heard something. [Xander Crews screams and presses 
against Killface]
Xander Crews: I bet it's a chud.
Killface: We really need to get you some pants.
Xander Crews: Yeah, that's not a pickle.
Killface: I know. It's your penis.
Xander Crews: My penis? [deepens voice] My penis.
Killface: Barnaby...
Xander Crews: Scrinching back!
%
Xander Crews: So, what's the plan here, big 'un?
Killface: Well, first we follow this vented scum pipe to the lair of Torpedo 
Vegas, where we'll affect ingress through the drain in the men's lavatory. Once 
past the perimeter, you'll distract the first guard. [Xander is standing naked 
in front of a guard, rubbing his nipples]
Xander Crews: Oh, me so horny! You distracted?! Oh, you like tea bag, Chinatown?
Killface: While I excecute a stealth kill. [Killface comes up behind the guard 
and snaps his neck]
Guard: Ah, so...
Killface: Ha ha! Shh shh shh shh shh shh...yes, go see your mommy.
%
Killface: Then I'll face off with Torpedo Vegas mano-a-mano. Probably with 
katanas. [Killface slashes at Vegas with a katana]
Torpedo Vegas: You win this round... Killface... [the top half of his torso 
begins to slide off.]
Killface: Then I'll have a tearful reunion with Simon and we can all go home. 
Bing bong bing.
Xander Crews: Yeah. My part's kinda gay.
Killface: Hah! Wait til you hear Plan B!
Xander Crews: Uh...what's Plan B?
[They Round a corner and are faced with a dozen gun-wileding guards]
Guard: Fleeze, douche bags!
Killface: I don't actually have one.
%
Xander Crews/Barnaby Jones: So that's your plan? Break in there, kill all the 
guards, and rescue Simon?
Killface: A simple, logical progression, Barnaby. [They are hit by spotlights]
Chinese Guard: Fleeze, douchebags!
Xander Crews/Barnaby Jones: Yeah... yeah pretty much writes itself.
%
Killface: Pneumatic tubes eh?
Torpedo Vegas: Obviously.
Killface: Can't put coins in those.
Torpedo Vegas: They were very clear on that. I'm not even sure where they go. 
All I know is that I can't put coins in them can I?
Killface: I -
Torpedo Vegas: Because I can't put coins in it!
%
Torpedo Vegas: I don't even have any coins you bitch!
%
Torpedo Vegas: He's like a kid in a candy shop, and that candy is... success. 
And I'm that friendly man at this cash register with a handle bar mustache 
*chuckles*
Xander Crews/Barnaby Jones: What?
Killface: I think I'm missing the key reference.
Torpedo Vegas: I can't have people sneaking in here leaking dooky water on my 
rugs. That's unacceptable.
Xander Crews/Barnaby Jones: I HAVE PATTY HEARST SYNDROME!
Killface: Barnaby just-
Torpedo Vegas: I'm getting furious at you, you don't even have any pants on.
Xander Crews/Barnaby Jones: Neither does he!
Torpedo Vegas: Well he doesn't have a penis! As far as I can tell...
Killface: I - uh -
Xander Crews / Barnaby Jones: Yeah, what is the story on that?
Killface: Oh, like you can talk.
Xander Crews: Hey, my penis fills an entire tall-boy.
[Quick cut to Xander, as Awesome X, dancing in front of the X-ticles, naked 
except for a beercan covering his groin and shouting "Master Cylinder!" through 
a megaphone. Cut back to Torpedo Jones' lair]
Torpedo Jones: [Scoffing] I'm sure it doesn't fill it.
%
Killface: Don't listen to him, he's crazy!
Xander Crews: Was Patty Hearst crazy when she kidnapped the Lindbergh twins?
Killface: Barnaby - just...turn six, alright?
%
Torpedo Vegas: Okay, I'll let you have the kid back if, and this is the part I 
kinda like, if you two fight to the death.
Killface: [Immediately] Done.

this pickle! Oh, we were supposed to get-

face repeatedly] Yeah, okay, relatively. Okay, okay, Barnaby?

Xander Crews/Barnaby Jones: Do you hear a dial tone? 'Cause Barnaby Jones is 
off the hook!

ear off, Xander screams and falls] Oh, son of a bitch!

Xander Crews/Barnaby Jones: My ear! Somebody put it in milk! [Killface spits it 
out]

down on the ear and presumably eat it while harrumphing]

Xander Crews/Barnaby Jones: Oh, you're fuckin' dead.
Killface: Yes, that's the spirit, Barnaby. [Xander smashes Killface in the 
face] Oh you're really selling it.

Killface: Okay, Barnaby?
Xander Crews/Barnaby Jones: Hey, I'm Killface, and I have a plan! Let me shoot 
your fuckin' eyes out! And then, let's wander around a fuckin' sewer our whole 
lives, looking for my fat ass, weirdo kid!

Killface: [About Xander Crews] Absolute monarch of all bumsnackers.
%
Killface: [To his son Simon] I hate to say it, but frankly, you're becoming 
something of a liability. You'll never get that hermit crab at this rate.
%
Xander Crews: You got my money?
Killface: It's right here! You got my key?
Xander Crews: Duh!
Killface: [Petulant] You don't have to be crappy.

[Arranging to swap the $20 billion check for the Annihilatrix key]
Xander Crews: We threw 'em! We throw 'em on three!
Killface: No, I-I think it's windy for...
Xander Crews: [Yelling quickly] One two three!
[Startled, Killface throws the check; it is caught by the wind before Xander 
(who didn't throw the key) can catch it]
Xander Crews: [Beat]... what the fuck, dude?!
Killface: You said throw it!
Xander Crews: Why?!... did I say that?!
Killface: 'Cause you're an idiot! And a liar! You didn't even throw yours!
[Pause]
Xander Crews: I was gonna keep them both!
Killface: You - Well, serves you right then!

[After Xander threatens to power up the Annihilatrix]
Killface: Xanderby, wait!
Xander Crews: Does this thing just start like a freaking car? Retarded.

Killface: Oh my God, you've armed it!
Xander Crews: Ahhh! Why did I also do that?
Killface: What is wrong with you?!
Xander Crews: My parents never established boundaries!

Killface: It's alright, there's a failsafe.
Xander: I don't know or care what that is!

Simon: Hahahaha... Boosh!

Killface: Where are we, what are we doing?
Dottie: We're going broke, is what we're doing
Killface: Well, that's hard to believe. I know we're all making sacrifices.
Dottie: (on €149 Schnapps) But I paid for this personally.
Killface: No, you didn't.
%
Killface:Oh, the smell of those barbecues. It’s like, just put my nose in a

Mr. Ford: Well... bad is a relative term.

Mr. Ford: Basically, I just make stuff up and fax it over there.

Dottie: They don't eat pie.
Killface: Yes, they do.
Dottie: Have you ever actually met a black person?

voice]

Xander: Your Earth-Man commands you! [Clanking and whirring sound]

Xander: A Year?! It's really been a whole year? What's today?
Camera Man: Thursday.
Xander: Oh my God, it has been a year.
%
Camera Man: Why not just go live with your girlfriend?
[Clip shows, of Grace Ryan standing outside her door with a pie.]
Xander: If I wanted to be smothered to death, I'd go back to the Xcalibur and 
fess up. If I go back to the Xcalibur and fess up, I'll be smothered to death. 
That's in our Charter.
%
Xander: So, what's this whole movie deal about Killface?
Camera Man: Actually, he's running for president.
Xander: He's what?! How?!
Camera Man: Yeah, cause when he activated the Anihalatrix, he cured Global 
Warming.
Xander: Wait, no, I turned it on!
Camera Man: Well, he says he did.
Xander: Son of a BITCH!
Cmaera Man: Yeah, so do cabs ever come by here?
Xander: Well, you know what? If he's running for President, then so am I!
Camera Man: Well, it takes, like, tons and tons of money to run for president.
Xander: [Holds up check containing his billions.] Well, is that enough? Ka-kow!
Camera Man: Hey, when did you get the check back?
Xander: Oh, just right after that whole incident with it blowing away.
[Flashback, Xander comes down from Annihilatrix in elevator]
Xander: Yeah, have fun getting the shit stomped outta you by the Xtacles when I 
go back to my house to get my Awesome X gear from that hooker who was living 
there the last time I... [check blows into his face] ...checked.
%
Xander: Apparently, it's been here the whole time...SUCKERS!!

Carter: Mr. Ford, via satellite. American voters--what do they want?
Mr. Ford: Really, all Americans want is cold beer, warm pussy, and someplace to 
take a shit with a door on it.

Carter: Up next...
Mr. Ford: (interrupting) I mean you don't want the dog looking at you.
Carter:Ok...

Carter: Immigration--why not have a massive pedestrian overpass to Canada?

Xander: Man, I was gonna do a pedestrian overpass to Canada. I was gonna call 
it the "Spicspan."

Xander: I need somebody who gets me, and also somebody who's a fighter, Stan. 
Just a tenacious smashin' bastard.
Stan: Yep.
Xander: He may be a little older...
Stan: Mm-hmmm.
Xander: Maybe a little balder...
Stan: Well...
Xander: But he's still the only player in NFL history to get two safeties in a 
single game.
Stan: [pause] I'm sorry?
Xander: Yes, Stan--two-time Pro Bowler Fred Dryer!
Stan: You mean, TV's Hunter?
Xander: He was Hunter?!

Killface: [Observing the campaign bus for the first time} Wendell, you've 
outdone yourself!

Killface: If there's a few bucks left over, you know, go get something nice.
[24 hours earlier in a hotel]
Wendell: [into phone] Yeah, hey I'd like a $9,000 prostitute, please. Oh, do 
you have nine $1,000 ones? Yeah, good, and if you got an albino, send her up

like, half a bottle of melatonin, six beers, this whole fucking bucket of 
chicken--the sandman is comin'.

Killface: Don't you have any sodding leads?
Wendell: [holding panties] Just these, I guess the assassin must've dropped 
them.
Val: [whispering, hidden in closet] Damn it!
Wendell: Which... [inhaling deeply from panties] actually might just be a red 
herring.
%
Xander: You, Grace, do the roar.
Grace: What?
Xander: Roar like the "Team Jaguar" jaguar. [Grace roars quietly] Damn it, 
you're an apex predator. [Grace roars louder] Yeah! That's how she sounds when 
I'm bangin' her.
[Talking head]
Grace: I know, I just...can't stay mad at him. I'm gonna have his babies.

Camera Man: Is that...?
Grace: Uh-huh.
Camera Man: Shouldn't that be in a freezer?
Grace: Sometimes I like to hold them.

Dottie: We can't afford an airplane.
Killface: Well, maybe if you'd lay off the platinum-infused highballs.

Dottie: You couldn't pour pee out of a boot if the directions were on the heel.
Wendell: Woman, they had pricing tiers!
Dottie: Oh, go tell it to your albino whores.
Wendell: I...will not even dignify that with a response.
Killface: Yeah, please don't.

Killface: [after Simon shoots down Xander's plane] Take that, you bum-snacking 
Republican!

Grace: If you leave me to burn to death in this plane, we are just finished!
Xander: Well...we'll always have Vegas.
Grace: That wasn't me!
Xander: Well...okay.

Grace: You bastard! God, still can't stay mad at him! [Jumps out after him]
%
Stan: Thank you for saving me.
Xander: Hey, don't get all Sophie's Choice, man. You know, think of all the 
sympathy cooz I'm gonna get. "Oh, where's your girlfriend," "Oh, she burned to 
death," "Oh, my god, put your penis in my vagina." I'll be killin' it, man.

[Suddenly Grace falls and manages to grab on to Xander, hanging on as they 
float down]
Xander: You are like a bad penny.
%
Xander: [talking head] So, this is probably on the down-low, [picture of Xander 
standing over a shot panda] but every year I go on these sorta...well, I guess 
they're like "grey market safaris."
Interviewer: Is that a panda bear?
Xander: Yep, the most dangerous game.
Interviewer: Man! Man is the most dangerous game.
Xander: Well, tell that to a mommy panda protecting her cubs.
Interviewer: That's disgusting!
Xander: You should see when they skin it. [Xander pulls the microphone down to 
his mouth] No, seriously. You'd puke your guts out

Killface: You should be out doing this too.
Taqu'il: Two movies: Surviving the Game, Deliverance. Not gonna happen.

Stan: And so now, Mr. Crews will hunt.
Xander: Well, then, put down the bamboo.
Stan: What fucking bamboo?
Xander: You gotta put a big pile of it down, and then the mommy panda comes out 
and she's all, "gotta find some bamboo for my babies," and you're like [fires 
shotgun] POW! Peel'er one

Xander: You think they're looking for us?
Killface: Both presidential candidates lost in a...duck bog? They must be.

Dottie: Well, it's not like we can stay out there all night.
Taqu'il: No, I can't believe I've been missing out on this white-knuckle thrill 
ride. Lookit, Junior's makin' a move!
Dottie: God love him.
Stan: All right, who's ready for another Tom Collins?
Dottie: See, now he gets me.

Killface: [going towards duck call] Come on, it's over that way.
Xander: Dibs on the dark meat...
Killface: Shut up!
Xander: ...she said.
Killface: Turn six!

Killface: It's the international, you know, cry for help in the wilderness, 
bang bang bang, three quick shots.
Xander: Where'd you hear that?
Killface: It was in...oh, God, what was it? There was this whacking great 
bear...
Xander: Oh, was it that movie The Bear?
Killface: Shut up, no, it was...
Xander: B.J. and the Bear?
Killface: Tony Hopkins was in it.
Xander: Oh, God, is he great?
Killface: I could watch him read the phone book.
Xander: And pay money to see it.
Killface: I'd like to just smell his hair.
%
Killface: Do you want to argue over it until we both die of hypothermia?
Xander: No, but I'm prepared to!

%
Killface: Three quick ones, on three...one...

Dottie: ...and, as you know, American voters insist on a Christian president.
Killface: That's me. I'm Christian in spades!
Dottie: But you have to be subtle about it.
Killface: I'm subtle in spades!
Taqu'il: They also don't want you to use the word "spades" all the damn time.

Grace: As a Democrat, don't you support a woman's right to choose?
Killface: You mean her right to be a whore?

Xander: (on headline outing Simon) BOOSH! Dude, we have got to jump on this 
with both feet.

Interviewer: There's no record of you ever working for the Department of Labor.

Interviewer: So you and Ronnie... A little history?
Xander Crews: A little bit, yeah... [Flashback to Ronnie preparing to rape 
Xander in season 1] Which... Not what I call making love. I'd call it "The 
Shame-spear... of... hurt".

Awesome X: We need to go warn Killface.
Ronnie: But why to help not only mortal enemy, but also political opponent?
Awesome X: Not that it's any of your business, but...I have no plausible 
explanation.

Killface: How about this: vote for me, or I push this dung heap of a planet 
smack into the sun!
Dottie: Look, I worked hard on those, and since the Annihilatrix couldn't push 
me to the store, I'd appreciate it if you'd focus on the damn talking p--!

Xander: The what?
Killface: Um... [Lamont quacks]
Xander: Why does he get a spirit animal? I think my buzzer's broken!
Killface: Is that the one about tariffs?
Carter: No, it's the one that says you have to be at least 35 years old and a 
US citizen in order to be President.
Killface: Well, that can't be right. I'm not even a legal resident.
Xander: And I'm only 33.
Carter: So, follow-up--why are you idiots wasting everybody's time when you 
can't even be elected?

Interviewer: And they are good looking slacks. Are they stain resistant?

Sinn: Who is soon to give birth to what I can only assume will be a giant, 
hideous ant-baby unwittingly sired by crippled billionaire tycoon Xander Crews--
Xander: (watching in office) God...damn it.
Sinn: Now control the Annihilatrix, and your new President, in office thanks 
only to a corrupt Supreme Court...
Taqu'il: (watching from the Oval Office) And more specifically, Stephen Breyer. 
Boosh! (Makes toast with Stan)
Stan: And/or ka-kow!

Doctor: So listen. I can't give you an okay to...

Presidential Debate (Turns on X-ray of Xander's spine)
Xander: Uh, vaguely, yeah.

Xander: Yeah, that robot with the big tits!
Doctor: No, but that sounds awesome.
Xander: It is!
Doctor: I meant the Burt Reynolds movie where he's a hard-living stuntman.
Xander: That sounds awesome.
Doctor: It is. Anyway, one more impact to the neck, and you'll be paralyzed.
Xander: My third-greatest fear!
Doctor: Same basic plot as in the movie.
Xander: God, that sounds awesome.
Doctor: It is.
Xander: But who's gonna stop Hooper?
Doctor: Well, it's already out on DVD.
Xander: No, I mean the robot with the big tits.
Doctor: Really sounds awesome.
Xander: It is.
Doctor: Anyway...

Doctor: Oh my God, now my neck's broken!

Wendell: What! How could you even say that? I'm a freakin' force of nature 
here. Pew! Pew! Pew! Pew--
Xander: Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! ::crash::
Wendell: Oh...I'll get you a new lamp.
Xander: Yeah, that was actually a sconce.
Wendell: Still though...
Xander: Yeah, it's just...I kind of spent a lot of time developing the Awesome 
X brand.
Wendell: Totally, yeah and it's understandable, you know, you're protective of 
it.
Xander: And I hate for you to go up there and...
Wendell: I get it.
Xander: ...get your fat ass handed to you.
Wendell: Wow.
Xander: Yeah.
Wendell: You just, ah...went ahead and put it out there.
Xander: Well...
Wendell: Muffin Top X!
Xander: Well...
Wendell: Just so you know, this armor does not protect my feelings.
Xander: Ok, you know what? Yeah, do it.
Wendell: Really?
Xander: Yeah, because either your dumb ass dies or you somehow manage to kill 
the unspeakable horror about to spew forth from my ex-girlfriend's womb.
Wendell: Um...
Xander: Cause ah, you know, big picture, child support...
Wendell: You gonna...
Xander: I'm not saying perform an abortion...
Wendell: Oh my god...
Xander: But, let's see if you can't stab that thing while it's still in her 
belly.
Wendell: Could maybe stab her in the belly if I had a machete.
Xander: Well...your words.

group! (All Decepticles gasp)
Val: Steve mentioned that.

Wendell: You ever taken a dump and you throw up on your dick? (Discovers that

Deceptacle #2: Yeah, I still think that has clams.
Deceptacle #1: Well, I'm sorry the prison food truck didn't have a fresh load

Taqu'il: Man, this launch panel is just a breeder reactor wired to the ignition
