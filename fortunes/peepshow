Jez (This is fucking wicked. I'm almost definitely a musical genius. Maybe a 
tattoo... on my chest... but... of my face. Yeahh! Double me! Feel it!)

Mark: (You're not a paedo. You're definitely not a paedo.)

[While boarding the bus]
Mark: (Yes! "I am the lord of the bus!" said he.)
%
Mark: (Women don't like your hands under their bottoms, Mark. That's been 
established, that's a given.)
%
Mark: (Those kids have no idea whatsoever of what went on at Stalingrad. 
Although I can in no way compare my struggle reading it with that of the Red 
Army, it has been a very big read. )
%
TV: I'm basically looking to meet someone like myself.
Mark: (Pfftt. That's exactly the opposite of what I'm looking for.)
%
Jez: Now I know how whatshisname felt when he finished the Mona Lisa... 
Knackered.
%
Mark: (I don't want to go to Waitrose. I want a fuckbuddy.)
%
Mark: What does your sister do?
Toni: Not much. She's got leukaemia.
Mark: (That's what you get for trying to flirt.)
Mark: That's terrible. I'm so sorry. I suppose... I mean, at least it's not 
cancer.'
Toni: It's a form of cancer.
Mark: Man. That's terrible. My gran... died of cancer. Although, hopefully, 
your sister... won't. Obviously. Listen, let's talk about something else. 
Something fun.'
%
Mark: (Maybe he doesn't mind. Maybe nobody minds about things as much as me.)
%
Mark: (You can have good relationships with people who scare you. Just look at 
me and dad.)
%
Mark: You know Kerry, cancer Kerry, I need to find out, for a friend, the name 
of that Chinese doctor she was raving about, do you remember?
Jez: Sure. It was Doctor Ying Fu Yip... Wang Shong... Pang Fang Wang... Dang 
Dong Ning Po Ku.
Mark: Oh right. I see. I get it. You were lampooning me. It was a simple 
lampoon.
%
Super Hans: Oh what? So... Mr... Ocean Colour Pants doesn't get it? Well, 
quelle fucking surprise.
%
Super Hans: It's not who you know... It's who you blow.
%
Boy: Hey look, it's clean shirt.
Mark: (Clean shirt? What does that even mean? Isn't that good?)
...
Boy: Fuck off clean shirt!
%
Jez: You're a posh spaz.
Mark: Oh really? Well I'd love to know in what way I am a posh spaz.
Jez: In the way that you do posh, spazzy things like... tidying up and... 
ironing your socks.
Mark: I do not iron my socks!
Jez: Socks, shirts, whatever!
%
Toni: I tell you, you find out who your real friends are when you set fire to 
Hampton Court maze because you can't take any more of your husband's shit.
%
Jez: (If I laugh at everything she says, I'm bound to at least get a suck job.)
%
Jez: (Jesus. How did I get trapped with her? She's definitely the most boring 
person here.) [Looks at group of people] (I mean, they look great, they're 
probably talking about how they're going to make a real life porn movie with a 
proper story and everything... I could do the music.)
%
Jez: (I mean, you can't catch cancer... I'd have heard... Someone would've 
said...)
%
Jez: Listen to you, you beautiful... crazy thing... I meant, the cancer.
Paula: I'm sorry? Which cancer?
Jez: The bloody cancer! Eating you away!
Paula: Ok... Would you like it if I did have cancer?

[Leaving Sophie on the bus, having failed miserably to woo Toni the previous 
night]
Mark: (Yeah that's the way, Sophie is the one. Toni is Russia: Vast, 
mysterious, unconquerable. Sophie is Poland: Manageable... won't put up too 
much of a fight.)
%
Mark: See, by the winter of 42, the whole city was surrounded by the massed 6th 
army, it was pressing and pressing, the Russians couldn't hold on much longer, 
many wanted to submit...
Toni: Mark, you know I just don't bang anyone, yeah. I'm not some kind of 
next-door fuck jar.
Mark: No, no, of course not, what I mean is that the German supply lines were 
stretched, Zhukov countered and the siege was broken. And that's the story of 
Stalingrad.
%
Mark: [Putting on socks.] (I wonder what kind of socks Sophie wears. Do women 
wear socks? Well, yes, sometimes, is the answer to that. Socks before or after 
trousers, but never socks before pants, that’s the rule. Makes a man look 
scary – like a chicken.) [Jeremy walks by, wearing only socks.] (He just does 
not give one solitary shit.)
%
Mark: [Before having toast for breakfast] (Brown for first course, white for 
pudding. Brown is savoury, white's the treat. Of course I'm the one who's 
laughing because I actually love brown toast.)
%
Jez: Super Hans says he's come up with a bass loop for our new track that is so 
good, that when he tried turning it off... he literally couldn't... he actually 
physically couldn't do it.
%
Mark: (Work-shy freeloader.)
Jez: (Tight-fisted cockmuncher.)
%
Jez: (You wouldn't ask the Chemical Brothers to do your laundry for you; they'd 
be off their tits.)
%
Mark: (I mean, what's the worst that could happen? She could say no. Actually, 
that would be terrible. It would destroy me if she said no.)
%
Mark: (People like him should wear stickers; they've got them for their cars. 
Oh, yeah, great idea, Adolf.)
%
Mark: How's your day going thus far? Did you have a nice shower or bath?
Sophie: Why, do I smell?
Mark: God, no, you don't smell. I mean, you smell nice. Not that I've smelt you.
%
Jez: (Super Hans said he'll be here in twenty minutes. That means I've got at 
least an hour.)
%
Mark: [Drawing a cartoon.] (What the hell is that? That is very gay, that's 
what that is. Come on, go crazy. You're hungry, like the wolf.)
%
Jez: We are NOT the Hair Blair Bunch!
%
[Changing his mind about leaving the Nazi cartoon on Sophie's desk]
Mark (A bloody swastika! That is the single worst, single, bloody idea ever. I 
mean, a swastika!?) [Discovers the cartoon has disappeared from Sophie's desk] 
(It's gone! It's happened! Oh yeah, do what Jeremy would do! Thanks Jeremy you 
tit!) [Bangs his head twice against wall]
%
Toni: So, what you're saying is, these products are essential? The kind of 
products no one could do without?
Jez: Well... You're kind of making me say that.
%
Mark: (She's ignoring me. Of course she's ignoring me, this morning I sent her 
a bloody swastika.)
%
Mark: [Trying to open his desk drawer] (Why don't I get this fixed? Why don't I 
ever get this fucking thing fixed?! Every night it's f... Ah, it always comes 
out eventually, fuck it.)
%
Mark: I mean, not that.
%
Jez: The first thing to say would be that this is not pyramid selling.
Mark: You're doing pyramid selling?!
Jez: No, no, not pyramid selling.
Mark: I can't believe you're into pyramid selling.
Jez: Listen, listen. It's not pyramid selling, it's... network... marketing and 
it's a guaranteed money making... Mark! I've seen the, the charts!
Mark: Oh the "charts". There are "charts". Why didn't you tell me about the 
"charts".
Jez: Are you... trying to... piss on my bonfire?
Mark: I'm trying to... protect you from... pissing all over yourself.
Jez: I'm not about to piss... all over myself. I'm... I'm pissing into the... 
bigtime.
%
Mark: Listen, Jeremy, you don't seem to understand. Nothing you want is ever 
going to happen. That's the real world. Your hair isn't red, people don't walk 
around on stilts. Maybe somewhere you can earn a living sitting around, 
drinking margaritas through a curly plastic straw, but in this world, you've 
got to turn up, log on and grind out.
Jez: But, yeah, if you get in early ...
%
Mark: (Maybe she will think it was charming. Yeah, maybe. Just keep clear of 
her till you've worked out a - I could say Jeremy had a gun and made me sing it 
... because he's a crackhead and he does that sort of thing all the time. Yeah, 
that sounds great. Me living in my crackhouse. Maybe you could be a crackbitch 
and sit on my -)
[He sees Sophie]
(Shit! Shit, sugar, fudge, piss, poopants, bollocks.) [In the stationery 
cupboard.] (Blitzkrieg! I'm in the Ardennes! You can't touch me in the 
Ardennes.)
%
Mark: (Everything's okay in the cupboard. I'm safe in the cupboard.)
%
Jeff: Mark. You're in the stationery cupboard.
Mark: That's right, Jeff.
%
Mark: (I'll be able to order him around. Not horrible, just... Jeremy, could 
you file this for me? Jeremy, could you take that for me? Jeremy could you suck 
this for me?... Jesus! Where did that come from?)
%
[Interviewing Jeremy, for a filing position]
Barbara: ...now, do you have any experience in this field?
Jez: Eh, I've done quite a lot actually, I mean not formal filing, but you 
know, alphabetabecising the videos, doing the spices, I suppose what I'd want 
to do is build on that experience in a professional... zone, SPHERE. I meant, 
sphere. (God, that sounded amazing, don't accidentally get the bugger!)
Barbara: You're doing great...
[she ticks "Poor" in the "Experience", "Knowledge" and "Performance level" 
boxes on her sheet]
%
Jez: No, challenging is right... Umm... But, a bit more of a relaxing 
challenge, more like doing a crossword than a tracheotomy.
%
Jez: You're pissing on my bonfire!
Mark: There is no bonfire!
Jez: That's because you keep pissing on it!
%
Mark: (Well that was a fucking disaster. I want compensation. I want 
reparations. I want the Rhineland. It's going to be 1919 all over again, fuck 
the inevitable backlash.)
%
Mark: I like you. Is that such a crime? Should I be hounded to the ends of the 
earth, just for liking you? I like you, and if you can't handle it, you can 
just, you know, fuck off.
%
Mark: (Life is all pain. Pain, rejection and gloom. Why do we even pretend that 
there's anything other than a yawning blankness at the heart of... Hey! 33% 
extra free! I'm doing excellent shopping. My depressed state of mind is making 
me even more frugal than normal.)
%
Jez: You realise tinned food is just for crackheads and wars.
%
Jez: I just came here to tell you we've been invited to a very wicked party.
Mark: Do I look like the kind of man who goes to wicked parties?
%
Jez: But, it's better this way... two guys... we've got to get out there! 
Grooving! Doing it! You know? I mean, it's been a long time for either of us, I 
mean, I haven't had my oats in something like two weeks!! (Nine months and 
thirteen days.) I mean look at us! [Holds up a tissue box] People are going to 
think we spend the whole time wanking.
%
Mark: (Ok, well, I'm here, so I'll just sit here and drink. No one can stop me 
doing that. Just drink myself to death.)
%
[In a toilet cubicle with Toni, Jeremy and Valerie]
Mark: (I've got to take Jeremy's advice more often: I'm out on a date with a 
teenage goth, smoking pot in the Lazerbowl toilets... this is it. This is 
literally, it. This is the sort of thing people do when they're having a good 
time.)
%
Mark: (I've been initiated. I am a drug user! Fuck the police!)
%
Mark: What if I lose it? I'm not gonna do a poo am I, Jez?
%
Jez: [Eating chicken wings] (This should be in the bag. Why isn't this in the 
bag? She looks like she hates me.) [Toni looks on in disgust]
Jez: What? It's eat as much as you can.
Toni: No, it's eat as much as you'd like. There's no competitive element 
involved.
Jez: At 3.99, I think I know who's winning.
%
Jeff: So Valerie, who's your favourite member of S Club?
Valerie: Oh, I'm not really into them. But I hear they have a big gay 
following. [mimes oral sex]
%
Mark: For the worst thing that could possibly happen, this is actually going 
extremely well.
%
Mark: (Don't think about it. If you don't think about it, it won't happen.)
%
Mark: I'm bowling all right, I'm bowling FRUIT! I've reached the next level, 
I've gone BEYOND!
%
Mark: (She does look kind of great in my pajamas. That's sick. Why is that 
sick?)
%
[Discussing politicians with Mark and Alan]
Jez: What I mean is that they should be more honest. I mean, at least Tony 
Adams from the IRA, he's like "Yeah, I shoot people, I like shooting people!" I 
mean, if they were more honest, then maybe people would vote and not switch 
straight over when the news comes on.
%
Jez: Mark likes Israel, I'm Palestine. Makes it much more interesting if you 
pick sides.
%
Super Hans: You passed out after the love beans... thought the table was being 
ironic.
%
[In flash back of drug induced state]
Jez: (Floss is boss, Floss is boss).
[Begins to strangle Super Hans with dental floss]
Jez: FLOSS IS BOSS! FLOSS IS BOSS!.
%
Mark: (This is the worst thing to happen to anybody ever.)
%
Mark: (Good old unfriendly Mr. Patel. Never says a word whether you're buying 
corn flakes, fabric softener... or gay porn.)
%
Super Hans: We're going to have parties that go beyond fun and actually get a 
bit nasty.
%
Jez: Will you walk, like some stupid.. duck? Or will you drive, like Clarkson?
%
Jez: The bad thing. That was the bad thing.
[Cut to shot of Super Hans performing oral sex on Jeremy the previous night]
Super Hans: Alright. My turn now.
%
Sophie: Are you sure you can get home from here?
Mark: Hmmm. (You can never go home again. Winter's coming. Is this Stalingrad? 
Is this where it all ends?)
%
Jez: Look mate, I'm next door. I heard you. Your... noise. Last night.
Super Hans: Oh, that. That was nothing. That was... press-ups.
Jez: Yep, well, you certainly seemed to enjoy the last few... a lot.
%
[Entering Barbara's empty office late at night]
Mark: (Hey Barbara, thought we should have a follow up meeting re: the phones 
thing... Oh, you're not here.) [opens desk drawer] (Well, I'll just leave my 
new idea in your desk, give you time to think about it. Yeah, so my new idea is 
urine.) [urinates into drawer] (Loads and loads of urine, flooding your 
drawers. What do you think about that? Don't you think that would be just the 
ticket?) [urinates on a folder on the floor] (Yeah, you're getting some too!) 
[phone rings, Mark answers] JLB Credit, fuck off please!
%
Therapist: Often I like to kick things off with a bit of word association. It's 
kind of a fun way...
Mark: Is it therapy?
Therapist: Not really, no. I'll just say a word and you tell me the very first 
thing that pops into your mind.
Mark: (He's trying to therapise me.)
Therapist: Okay, let's start with an obvious one. Work.
Mark: (Snake-pit.) Snake... charmer.
Therapist: Just say the first thing that comes to mind. Money.
Mark: (Everything.) ...not everything.
Therapist: Children.
Mark: (Blind.) Uh, short.
Therapist: Father.
Mark: (Führer.) Football.
Therapist: Mother
Mark: (Sophie.) Fuck! No, not fuck!
%
Therapist: Have you ever done a Rorschach test? Just tell me what you see.
Mark: (A hairy twat. A hungry, devouring twat) ...a kitten?
%
Jez: (This was definitely a good idea. There's no chance this wasn't a good 
idea.)
%
Mark: It's payback time.
Jez: And she's paying back... in fear dollars!
%
Mark: (I've made a psycho call to the woman I love, I kicked a dog to death, 
and now I'm going to pepperspray an acquaintance. Something ... I mean, what's 
happened to me?)
%
Sophie: I hope when you're back on my team, we can get back to normal.
Mark: Your team? (Heal and grow. Heal and grow.) Well, I guess it's very nice 
for the big lady to come down here and talk to the little man. I'm just 
surprised you can see me from all the way up there in your ivory tower.
Sophie: Oh, if you're gonna be like that, you can fuck off.
%
Mark: (Can't do it. It's too much. I'm not American; I can't date.)
%
Jez: (I'm gonna blow this gaff wide open.) Uh... yeah. I spent, uh, some time 
with Ray before he... went and I just wanted to say that, um, I think we should 
all remember that Ray, by the end... he loved Jesus. Now I know, Liz, there's 
no proof for Jesus, but then there's no proof for lots of things like science 
or the stock market and... we believe in them. Look, what I'm trying to say is 
that if I was dying and I decided that even though I'd never particularly been 
into say, uh... Enya before, but that now I really really was into Enya and 
that in fact I thought Enya was great and that Enya died for our sins and I 
wanted an Enya themed funeral with pictures of Enya and lots and lots of 
mentions of... Enya. Then I think it would be a bit bloody rich for my sister 
to ban all mention of Enya from my funeral! Yeah?
[Everyone applauds, Liz frowns]
%
[Discussing life and death with Mark]
Sophie: Sometimes, we're so wrapped up in the nonsense of life...
Mark: Right yeah... I mean, if I want an Xbox, why don't I just get an Xbox?
Sophie: [confused] ...yeah.
Mark: (You're losing her) It's a brief candle... a bloody brief candle.
%
Jez: ('Abandon self-cherishing, love only others'. Yeah well Mr. Dalai Lama, I 
suppose you've got to be a suck-up if you haven't got your own country.)
%
[Kissing Sophie at Jez's uncle's wake]
Mark: (Oh, my God. Umm... What about my abnormal knackers? Ooh, this is nice. 
How weird are they? What I really need is a good, long look at another man's 
bollocks. But that's so fraught with potential problems.)
%
Jez: There's only so much happiness in the world and they're hoarding it all!
Mark: That's not how happiness works! (It completely is.)
%
Mark: What do I know about love and happiness? I know you have to play dirty, 
my friend.
%
Mark: (Yeah, fuck carrot and stick, he's making the stick out of carrot.)
%
Mark: (Careful, there's man love and there's business love, and never the twain 
shall meet.)
%
Mark: (Yeah, you won't be so cocky Jeff, when I come into the office with a 
Kalashnikov and 200 rounds of ammunition. I'm probably exactly the kind of 
person who could end up doing something like that.)
%
Mark: Dancing? Y-yes... dancing... I love... dancing... (It makes me look like 
a coma victim being stood up and zapped with a cattle prod.)
%
Jez: (God, this is such a mess. It's fantastic.)
%
Jez: Maybe I should send her a bit of ear. Or a finger. Just to show I'm really 
serious.
%
Mark: (I've walked into my own personal nightmare. Must remain non-uptight for 
Sophie. Even if they make me play trust exercises with their genitals.)
%
Jez: (Jesus, Mark's such a honky. I'm definitely the alpha-est male here. He's 
probably here for community service. He looks like he's actually getting a bonk 
on. I'm definitely king of the hippie jungle.)
%
Mark: Look, Jez, what I'm trying to say is, for better or worse, the sixties 
happened and now sex is fine. But can't we take the best of that--the nice 
music, the colors, the I Have A Dream, et cetera--but not have to face the ... 
squalor?
%
Jez: Who needs romance when you're doing it up the bum?
%
Nancy: You can't imagine your mum having sex with a black man? That's pretty 
racist, Jeremy!
%
Mark: (If I want to act relaxed, it's going to take all my cunning, skill, and 
concentration.)
%
Mark: (I wonder which of my treasured possessions they'll be putting in each 
others anuses tonight.)
%
Mark: (God it's so easy being a freak. No wonder they're ten a penny. I should 
get extra marks for not feeling a fucking thing.)
%
Nancy: This place is amazing, Gwyn. How can you afford it all?
Gwyn: Well I guess I've just been very lucky. Money's an energy and lots of it 
has always flowed towards me. Particularly after my parents died.
Jez: Cosmic.
%
Jez: (You're not going to out-hippie me you fucking hippie.)
%
Mark: (God it's happening. It's Woodstock. It's Altamont. It's My Lai.)
%
Mark: (I'm Louis Theroux. I'm Louis Theroux with his wry smile at the orgy.)
%
Mark: (Sure, an orgy sounds great, but you're basically just multiplying the 
number of people you're not going to be able to look in the eye afterwards.)
%
Jez: (This is good. This is like watching a porno, except I can't see anything, 
I haven't got a hard-on, and I want to cry.)
%
Mark: We have something special. Not my words, yours. We can't throw that all 
away just because I ... spy on you ... can we!?
%
[Jez approaches an acquaintance from school]
Jez: Gog!
Gog: Jeremy! What are you doing here?
Jez: Wouldn't you like to know, you big prick!
[Jez twists Gog's nipple]
Jez: Remember that time we made you wank off Percy's dog for a fiver?
%
Mark: (He hasn't got any massage oil. He's trying to make me obsess about 
massage oil. And it's worked!)
%
Jez: Is that? ... Oh my god it is! It's Gog!
Mark: Who's Gog?
Jez: It's Gog! In school, if you had to sneeze, you'd run up and do it in his 
face.
%
Super Hans: I'll tell you what, that crack is really moreish.
%
Gog: Hey, you know what I fancy right now? A kebab. Will you go down and get me 
a kebab?
Jez: [pause] You want me to...
Gog: I want a kebab.
Jez: What ... really?
Gog: [laughing] No-o! Why, were you gonna go and get me one?
[Everyone laughs at Jez]
Jez: No...
Gog: I can't believe you were gonna go and get me a kebab!
Jez: I wasn't!
Gog: [Stops laughing] Well, I want one now.
Jez: Right... really?
Gog: [laughs again] No-o! I'm shitting you, Jez! Jesus!
%
Mark: Jeremy, what is Super Hans doing?
Jeremy: [observes Super Hans] He's honking on his crackpipe.
Mark: Crack! Jeremy! I have company!
Jeremy: Relax Mark, everyone does drugs nowadays. "Look at Me, I'm Mark. I'm 
dying on a street in an Advert in the 80s."
%
Super Hans: What we really need to do is create a powerful sense of dread.
[Plays a long, low note on the keyboard]
Super Hans: See, the longer the note... the more dread!
%
Jez: (Useless...all useless. I wish they were all robots...I wish I were a 
robot...maybe I could punch through a wall...)
%
Mark: [Jeremy and Super Hans are trying to intimidate Gog] There, we have our 
answer. Can we please leave!?
Super Hans: We have to hurt him now, out of principal. Hit him with the fucking 
bat Jez.
Jeremy: Why do I have to hit him? Punch him with the glove.
Super Hans: Punch him? [holds up baseball glove] I can't even make a fist.
%
Jez: The only reason I don't go to church is that, for me, everything's a 
church. This room is my church, the hall is my church... Cost Cutters is a 
bloody cathedral.
%
Mark: (I've shot you Jeff. With a bullet made of Scottish finance regulations.)
%
Nancy:Why don't they ever talk about all the buses that made it safely?
Mark:Yes, I suppose the news should just be a dispassionate account of all the 
events of the day - except it would take forever.
%
Mark: I can take a joke as well as anyone, but if it happens again I'm taking 
it to a fucking industrial tribunal
%
Jez: (Come on, smile - you don't know I've got an ulterior motive for doing 
this.)
%
Jez: (She probably has really nice kidneys. Yeah, I'd fuck those kidneys real 
good.)
%
Mark: (She knows about cubits, she's not comfortable in her own skin, she's one 
of me!)
%
Mark: (Do a Columbo, do a Columbo.) [To shoe shop assistant] Just remind me, 
which university was it April's gone to again?
Assistant: Dartmouth.
Mark: Dartmouth, of course. Dartmouth. Thanks. (Good old Columbo. Just the one 
technique, of course. Still, shits on Quincy.)
%
Jez: I thought you did do Ancient History.
Mark: I did business studies Jeremy. For three years. And I spoke with you 
about it daily.
Jez: (I could tell him that's all ancient history now. He probably wouldn't 
like that joke.)
Jez: Oh well, that's all ancient history now!
[Mark looks unimpressed]
%
Super Hans: The secret ingredient [waves hand] is crime.
%
Jez: Stealing things just makes everything very cheap. Plus, you know how I 
feel about capitalism.
Mark: Yes, confused.
%
Jez: There's no quim likes to party...
Mark: ...like the quim down in Darty!
%
April: Who's your tutor?
Mark: [scanning noticeboard behind her] (Netball, Keyser Söze, MacLeish!)
%
Mark: You don't walk into the jaws of death--that's common knowledge!
%
Mark: I'm gonna leave a tenner and a note.
%
Mark: I'm dangerously close to getting what I want. Feels a bit weird.
%
Mark: At least I didn't have to watch her recoil at my scrotal scar.
%
Mark: (Is that it? Is that how easy it is to steal some education? Bloody hell, 
who's in charge? The world's just people walking around, going in to rooms and 
saying things. It's all a big swizzle!)
%
Mark: (Oh God she is just so lovely and she doesn't even realize it. Probably 
no one's ever told her. I should tell her!! No, don't tell her. If she 
realizes, I'm finished.)
%
Jez: So these are just rows and rows of books you don't like? Do you spend a 
lot of time not reading them?
Professor: (Angry) I think you've said enough, friend.
%
Jez: He's not a mature student, he's been a loan manager for the last five 
years. He lives with me and he eats ready meals and we play 'Guess the Revels' 
and watch Men In Black on our massive telly and we have a fucking. Good. Time.
%
Mark: [As Jez and Mark leave] (This is okay....it's just one of those things 
that will haunt me forever.)
%
Mark: If you can't have sex with the monkey, make friends with the 
organ-grinder.
Jez: Right. You didn't, did you? Try to have sex with a monkey?
%
Jez: You do realise I'm bored, Mark? I'm dangerously bored. Today I even 
considered doing that thing that that MP and Michael Hutchence did. You know. 
[Mimes putting a rope around his neck and masturbating]
%
...
Mark: And if you do do that, don't do it in here. The hook's almost off the 
wall as it is.
%
Jez: No Mark. I only told you for a laugh. You promised not to tell.
Mark: Hitler promised not to invade Czechoslovakia, Jeremy. Welcome to the real 
world!
Jez: But you said... what about your mum's life?
Mark: What does that even mean!? What are you going to do, KILL her?
%
Mark: (I have entered the abyss. I've bought a house in the abyss. I'm getting 
my post forwarded to the abyss.)
%
Jez: So I was gonna twat this geezer, and then it turns out they were both 
Polish!
Mark You were going to 'twat' a 'geezer'? Were you playing the 'Lock, Stock and 
Two Smoking Barrels' video game?
%
Mark:(Yep, civilization is definitely doomed.)
%
Mark: I've been turning this thing over and over in my head like a bloody 
horrible pancake.

[Mark consoles Sophie after she breaks up with Jeff.]
Mark: Does... does he beat you, Soph?
Sophie: God, no. He broke a plate once, but...
Mark: Does he come at you with a stick, Soph?
Sophie: No, never. It's nothing like that.
Mark: He does beat you though, mentally. And with his hands and with his fists.
Sophie: No.
Jeremy: Hey, Soph. You alright?
Sophie: Yeah, just getting my head together.
Mark: Oh God, your head - is it okay!?
%
Mark: We all hate you Jeff! You're a cocksucker!
%
Mark: I'm giving you the broom Jeff!
%
Jeremy: Brilliant, Mark. My mate and your woman have just gone off to fuck each 
other. What are we gonna do now? Go and make a tent in the living room and eat 
Dairylea? Is that what you want? Because that's what's gonna happen.
%
[discussing their marriage of convenience]
Nancy: You realise its only going to be an administrative procedure?
Jez: The happiest administrative procedure of our lives!
%
Jez: Oh don't marry those gays, Nancy. Marry me!
%
Mark: You do realise it's me you're talking to, not some Italian builder.
%
Mark: (Maybe it'll go really well and I'll have a double wedding with Jeremy on 
Friday. Oh god. She's coming over. Must... Think... Words... Funny words.)
Karen:Hi there
Mark: Hi, hi, say isn't it funny all the coffee, what's with all the coffee? 
Listen I'm just going to go over to my stupid friend and grrr, give her a good 
shake, but if you ever want to call me about anything then I'm in the book, 
Mark Corrigan (Too formal, lighten things up [winks at her]. Light, not slimey, 
ohhh can't retract the wink...unless...[winks a few times]) See you (Brilliant 
- the twitching freak, works every time)
%
Karen: Hey Mark, how's it going?
Mark: Hey Karen, pretty good, and you?
Karen: Good thanks
Mark: It was good to see you in Gino's. Got over the twitch by the way. Next 
time I have acupuncture, I'll get someone else to do it for me. [Karen giggles] 
(Hey! Look at me go, I'm charming!) Yeah so sorry if I was acting a bit weird, 
I guess I just wanted to see if you might want to hang out sometime?
Karen: Well that sounds nice
Mark: (I'm a natural! Maybe I should try it on someone better looking.)
%
Mark: (This is just not normal. Someone has got to do something. He's just 
going to stand there doing nothing like Jeff's the invading Chinese army. 
They're women, that old get out. Oh god, it's got to be me.)
%
Mark: (Great. The woman you love has been single for only a few seconds and 
you've already found her a nice new boyfriend. Nice job, Mr Fucking Stupid.)
%
Super Hans: She's got trouble written right through her. Like a stick of 
Brighton rock.
%
Super Hans: Where might you find a diphthong?
Mark: It's an element of speech.
Super Hans: Where might you find one?
Mark: In a word?
%
[as Jez walks up the aisle]
Mark: (I tried. I failed. Got to let him make his own mistakes. Just like Dad 
with me and the strimmer.)
%
Mark: (Got to stick it out. Keep being charming to Sophie, stay cold and 
unfriendly to Karen, without breaking social convention.)
%
Mark: (Brilliant. Probably looks like I was going to punch him, when actually I 
was going to use the Buddhist as a human shield).
%
Mark: (Public humiliation. Welcome to my world, Jeff. Although personally I 
wouldn't have picked that dress to cry on.)
%
Jez: Do you think maybe, if I plead and plead and plead, she'll forget all 
about it and things will go back to like before?
Mark: Honestly?
Jez: Quite honestly. Not brutally honestly.
Mark: Then... yeah, absolutely.
%
Mark: (Fish pie then missionary sex and Newsnight afterwards.)
%
Mugger 2: Alright mate?
Mugger 1: Will you lend us your phone mate?
Mark: [startled]...What?
Mugger 1: Lend us your fuckin' phone!
Mark: Why?
Mugger 2: Well I need to make a call.
Mark: ....Dont you have your own phone?
Mugger 2: Come on, lend us your phone.
Mark: Right... it's just... 'Neither a lender nor a borrower be'!
Mugger 1: Do you think we're some pair of shit-houses?
Mark: No! God, no! It's just a... It's a BlackBerry and....
Mugger 2: Give us your phone! Give us your wallet!
Mugger 1: Come on! Before we fuckin' do you!
Mark: (Do me? Are they going to rape me? Or kill me? If they rape AND kill me, 
I hope they kill me first....I sort-of win...) [Hands over the phone]
Mugger 1: Is that it? You got nothin' else?
Mark: [meekly] ...Yes
Mugger 2: What else?
Mark: There's my travel card? (That's right, Mark, help the muggers...what do 
you want, approval?)
Mugger 1: [They laugh at Mark's photo] Alright, now piss off!
Mark: [inwardly indignant] Oh this really takes the biscuit.
Mugger 2: FASTER..."
Mark: I thought it was at least the muggers who had to run off. The victim 
flees -
Mugger 1: FASTER!!"
Mark: [running] Oh this really leaves a sour taste.
%
Mark: (Note to self re: being the Fonz - Mark, you are *not* the Fonz.)
%
Big Suze: Hey, Jez! Look at all the lovely normal people.
%
Jez: "You've got to toughen up. This is the 21st century. You've seen 'Mad 
Max', haven't you? That's what's going to happen!
Mark: Mad Max isn't necessarily going to happen.
Jez: You're still living in your Hitchhiker's Guide world where you wander 
around in your dressing gown and have a nice cup of tea.
%
Mark: (They're alright with hitting, but apparently there's a massive taboo 
against stabbing.)
%
Jeremy: About Stu (He's a monk, he's gonna have fifteen years of spunk backed 
up. How am I supposed to compete with that?)
%
Jeremy: Yeah. Take that Stu, you lump of monk. God didn't protect you from my 
big fist.
%
Jeremy: (Still drinking alone, what's the big deal? If I drink a bottle of 
vodka and a man's there does that somehow make it alright?)
[Stu appears]
Stu: Hey man, I'm really parched, you mind if I have a swig of something?
Jeremy: Whatever.
[Stu drinks from the milk jug]
Jeremy: (God, that's what a man should look like. Look at that body. Those 
arms.)
Stu: Listen man, I know you still have feelings for Suze and that's fine. So, 
it's really nice to meet you, and...no hard feelings. Yeah?
Jeremy: Yeah
[Jeremy stands up to shake Stu's hand, but pulls back at the last moment and 
wiggles his fingers in front of his face and laughs]
Stu: What does that mean?
Jeremy: You know what it means, Stu, by how it makes you feel! That's what it 
means. [Stu begins to walk away] Welcome to big school!
%
Jeremy: (God I must look so cool to her, like Pete Doherty or Bukowski. Yeah, 
that's right honey, I'm a street fighting man. God she's probably getting wet 
just looking at me.) Hold your horses honey, I've got coupons for the Pringles.
%
Mark: (Look at me; I've got a girlfriend. A proper girlfriend reading a 
best-seller about child-abuse. I go out and have croissant. I'm just a normal 
functioning member of the human race and there's no way anyone can prove 
otherwise.)
%
[Super Hans nonchalantly flings Merry's laptop across the room]
Jez: Super Hans!
Super Hans: Oh, what? Oh, 'cause it's a computer you think it's made of spiders 
webs and magic? It's just a metal box Jez, they're indestructible.
%
Mark: I suppose doing things you hate is just the price you pay to avoid 
loneliness.
%
Jeremy: "If you build it, they will come". That's my market research.
Mark: Your market research is Field of Dreams? I mean, a man who made a 
baseball pitch in his garden for ghosts? That's your role model?
%
Jez: Mark, do you have to live quite so relentlessly in the real world?
%
Jez: People like lager and nuts.
Super Hans: People like Coldplay and voting for the Nazis. You can't trust 
people, Jeremy.
%
Jez: I'm definitely not co-managing a pub called 'Free the Paedos'.
%
Jez: I'm just really not happy with the name Free the Paedos. I mean, can't we 
call it something more normal like... The Swan and Tomato?
Super Hans: Yeah, or compromise? The Swan... and Paedo.
Jez: Yeah OK!
%
Mark:(I'd like to chemically alter my girlfriend's mood)
%
Mark: She's very ill. We need to get her to someone-
Jeremy: Who has more responsibility for her than us.
Mark: Exactly.
%
Super Hans: Did you try to section me?
Jeremy: No. (That sounded convincing.)
%
Jeremy: Do you really think if you give her back those papers, she's going to 
let you screw her?
%
Jeremy: (If I was getting sectioned, I'd put up more of a fight. Downside: 
Could get lobotimised)
%
Jeremy: Your dream is just everybody, grey, on the omnibus, eating grey sludge. 
That's your dream isn't it?
%
Jeremy: If YOU try to section me Mark you will have crossed a line and I will 
section you, so help me...
Doctor: Look guys. You've had your fun with the sectioning. There's going to be 
no more sectioning today.
%
Jez: Oh Suze, it's not scary; you just lose your sense of who you are and all 
that shit.
Big Suze: Will I still be able to play the piano?
Jez: Of course! Suze, they're mushrooms; they're completely natural! Nothing 
natural ever hurt anybody, that's a scientific fact.
%
Jez: If people only did everything they wanted everyone would just spend all 
day sitting on the carpet watching the poker channel, wanking and eating those 
expensive German biscuits. Probably.
%
Super Hans: Listen love, just a little tip alright? You're on the edge now and 
you need to pick the right way. One way's heaven, and the other... well... 
probably best not to think about that right now... but it's fuckin' 'orrible, 
yeah?
%
Jez: You da man!
Mark: I'm a man!
Jez: It's you da man.
Mark: Whatever, Jeremy, let's not quibble. I'm a Man!
%
Jez: (Shit. We're so angry together. The righteous indignation of the common 
man! Maybe we can start a union... The Woodworkers and General Persons Union.)
%
Jez: (Maybe we'll become best mates and he'll train me up to be a carpenter 
like Jesus. And if I get crucified, he'll start a religion in my name. 
Jeremism. 'I'm a Jeremist.' Nice.)
%
Jez: (It's not like I'm going to rape him. I could rape him... I'm not going to 
rape him.)
%
Jez: I'm going to get us both really high and then try to put my hand up her 
jumper.
Mark: That's your plan is it?
%
Mark: Let me out! Let me out I need a poo!
%
Mark: (This is the last friendship I have that's not backed up by a legally 
enforceable document.)
%
Mark:(Oh God. Can I do this? If I do this, even if I end up marrying Sophie and 
we live in a detached house in Surrey and we buy a holiday home in Umbria, our 
children will always look up at the face of a man who once crapped in a 
takeaway bag. Plus... I'd have to hide it here, somewhere in my room next to 
one of my things. I could throw it out the window. No, that's what they want 
you to do. That's where society's headed. People shitting in bags and throwing 
it out the window at each other. Well, I'm not going to be the first. Not in my 
name!)
%
Super Hans: Ooh yeah. These are the good times, love; after the initial nausea 
passes, but before the grinding comedown. Lovely.
%
Johnson: Is that normal pooing you're doing, Mark?
Mark: Yes, perfectly normal.
Johnson: Doesn't sound normal... Doesn't smell normal. This is bollocks, Mark! 
You know the credo: illness equals weakness. You're off the team.
%
Jez: So this is my big evening, is it? Me, tripping my nuts off, watching you 
do endless pooing.
%
Mark: Nothing means anything to you, does it? Friendship, loyalty - they're 
just fusty old words like sixpence and codpiece to you, aren't they?
%
Mark: (Looking at porn is like lying to Parliament. It used to be wrong but now 
it's all a big laugh.)
%
Mark: (Oh my God. I've fallen in love with her. Of course. Brilliant. How 
incredibly predictable. What a total fucking dope.)
%
Mark: (He's gonna get cancer and I'm not. I don't want him to but obviously one 
of us is going to get it and I'd rather it was him.)
%
Mark: Promise me you will not try to sleep with her.
Jez: I promise I will try not to sleep with her.
%
Mark: So. You slept with her. You promised.
Jez: I promised to try not to.
Mark: Yeah, well you didn't try very hard did you.
Jez: Mark, I tried incredibly hard. It just turns out it was literally 
impossible not to.
%
Jez: (How can Mark be in love with Big Suze? It's like Swaziland trying to 
invade China - it's a bloody political joke.)
%
Mark: (They're rubbing it in my face. It's like I've got his member in my face.)
%
Mark: (Great. Okay, so I've 'dumped' my sister. That's great. That feels good. 
I'm intrigued to see what I'm gonna do next. Maybe I'll ring up Grandad, and 
tell him I think he's a boring twat.)
%
Mark: [Whilst jogging] (Hey! Wow, I'm actually good at this. Maybe I'm a 
natural - yeah, I'm a jogger! Of course, there had to be a sport for me, I just 
never realised. Legs like two great steam locomotives, pumping away, I'm 
unstoppable - JESUS, is that a stitch? Fuck, I'm gonna be sick, I need to walk. 
Oh, I think I'm gonna puke, I'm literally going to die, ugh, what an idiotic 
boob I was back ten or eleven seconds ago.)
%
Jez: Crunchy Nut Cornflakes are just Frosties for wankers.
Mark: Frosties are just Cornflakes for people who can't face reality.
%
Jez: It's probably some young black kid who's been accused of stealing a bun, 
and I'm going to set him free.
%
Mark: No smoke without fire? Is that what 1000 years of British Judicial Law 
has come down to? No smoke without fire?!
%
Mark: Saying 'I Love You' is like firing first in a duel; if you miss, you're 
fucked!
%
Jez: Sometimes I tell them I love them early on on a first date just to get 
things off to a good start.
Mark: Doesn't that... devalue it a bit?
Jez: No. Maybe. A bit. Who cares, it works.
%
Mark: You'd be the first to admit that you're not the most rational thinker.
Jez: No I wouldn't!
Mark: You still don't understand what happens in Ocean's Eleven.
Jez: It's a complicated film.
Mark: It really isn't.
%
Jez: (This isn't wrong - just illegal - like drink-driving.)
%
Jez: Oh that is typical. "Jeremy can't be trusted to judge the woman he's 
sleeping with but ... Tony Blair can?"
%
Jez: Look Mark, I'm a musician, in case you'd forgotten. Yeah? I answer to a 
higher law. The law of "if it feels good, do it".
Mark: Oh, that's a great law isn't it? What's that, Gaddafi's law?
Jez: It's the musician's law. Colonel Gaddafi could not lay down a bass hook, 
Mark. That should be clear even to you!
%
Jez: (I'm in Twelve Angry Men. I'm the only one who's not angry. I'm horny. 
That's much nicer.)
%
Mark: Sophie! The Sophster! Sophistry!
%
Mark: So, a candle stuck in a wine bottle apparently doesn't cut it anymore. 
Now for a special night you have to have Class-A drugs and... fisting.
%
[About ecstasy]
Jez: Jesus Mark, why didn't you bang one?
Mark: Because I don't want to wake up dribbling in a phone box with a trucker's 
penis in my ear!
%
Mark: It's like I'm trapped in a giant aero!
%
Mark: (How did my house become a rave? This is probably how a squat starts. 
They'll never leave and eventually they'll brick me up in my room and ownership 
will pass to them because a high court judge will rule me to be officially not 
living life to the max.)
%
Mark: While we’re at it, there are systems for a reason in this world. 
Economic stability, interest rates, growth. It’s not all a conspiracy to keep 
you in little boxes, alright? It’s only the miracle of consumer capitalism 
that means you’re not lying in your own shit, dying at 43 with rotten teeth. 
And a little pill with a chicken on it is not going to change that. Now come 
on... fuck off.
%
Jez: (Oh yeah. Justice is done. Not actual justice, but, what I wanted to 
happen. Which is basically the same thing.)
%
[to Jez playing darts]
Mark: Are you aiming for the bulls-eye?
Jez: Yeah, 'course I am, it's the best thing on the board!
Mark: No, it isn't.
Jez: Mark, just look at it. It's tiny, it's red, it's right in the bloody 
middle. 'Course it's the best thing on the board!
%
Mark: (Oh great, she posted the guide book. I suppose I'm supposed to think 
that's incredibly charming and French. Well it's not, it's a waste of £8.99.)
%
Mark: (She's looking for company after a minute of uncomfortable silence. Well, 
get used to it, baby. There'll be a lot more where that came from when we're 
married.)
%
Super Hans: We'll be going to bed when Mark's getting his morning horn off the 
FT.
%
Jez: Right well, let's crack on.
Super Hans: Don't. Say. Crack, Jez. Yeah? Please. Not now. 'Cause you saying 
crack makes me think about crack and I love crack. So can you not say crack?
%
Mark: (Why won't that stupid bitch let me propose to her?)
%
Super Hans: I've got a monkey on my back the size of King Kong. I am being 
fucked by King Kong!
%
Mark: We're not going to be two of those idiots you hear about who go up a 
mountain in Flip Flops and Sombreros and have to be rescued.
Jeremy: Would you rather be one of those idiots they find frozen to death, 
drinking his own piss while badgers chew on his corpse?
%
Mark: [Dividing up his chocolate] There's seven segments, so that three each 
and one left over which is mine since... it's all mine.
Jeremy: Oh, the spirit of the The Blitz lives on. Fuckin' hell.
%
Jeremy: (She's so Beautiful and Fancy. If there weren't a junkie in my room 
shitting and retching and hurling, it would be just like Pride and Prejudice)
%
Mark: (At least he doesn't know about my emergency Twix).
%
Jeremy: (I'm so tired. She's gonna have a hell of a job coaxing a hard-on out 
of me. But I bet she'll manage)
%
Mark: (Yes, this me-not-loving-her business will sort of put me in a position 
of power in our marriage. Yes. I win.)
%
Super Hans: Drugs! Drugs! Drugs!
%
Super Hans: I'd probably be very angry with you right now, if I weren't so 
incredibly high.
%
Jez: Super Hans, are you trying to skin up with your feet again? Because it 
doesn't work, does it? It just makes a mess.
%
Jeremy: Why were you phoning me anyway, you big idiot?
Mark: Well, I wanted to talk some stuff through with someone didn't I? You 
big.. dick.
Jeremy: What stuff? You're not having gay feelings again Mark?
Mark: No, one time that happened.
%
Jeremy: So you accepted the acceptance?
Mark: I had to .. it was check mate.
%
Mark: She’s good for me, Jez. She’s dragging me into the twenty-first 
century with its meaningless logos and ironic veneration of tyrants. It’s all 
good, my friend.
%
Jeremy: I've got loads of really important stuff to do this weekend.
Mark: Jeremy, a carton of Mars Bar Milk, a small bag of marijuana, and a 
pirated DVD of Anchorman are not important things.
%
Jeremy: But what's Blair going to do?
Super Hans: Maybe he'll become an ethical porn star.
Jeremy: Or maybe he'll form a political supergroup. Blair, Bono on vocals, 
Clinton on sax.
Super Hans: Yeah, that's definitely going to happen. Geldof's gonna shit.
%
Sophie's mother: Oh, you grew a beard. Makes you look handsome, like a 
policeman.
Mark: Thank you. You're obviously very attractive, too. (Ugh! What am I going 
to do next? Tell her she's got lovely tits?)
%
[Mark shaves off his goatee]
Mark:(Goodbye beard. Hello familiar stupid face)
%
Jez: (I'm a motherfucker! That's literally what I am!)
%
Mark: You don't just declare war, Jeremy. You prime the press, you square 
things with the UN, you make up your reasons.
%
Jez: (It's almost like a moral decision, but not really 'cause nobody will find 
out.)
%
Mark: (Well, this isn't what I expected. You think you're going to play 
Simpsons Monopoly, and you end up an arsonist.)
%
Jeremy: Mark, we're out with a man who has guns! You're chucking his daughter 
and I've shagged his wife. Tonight is going, if a bit weird, extremely fucking 
well for us.
%
Mark: (I'm a firestarter! A twisted firestarter!)
%
Jez: Well... I did see him throw a petrol bomb, but I thought it might just 
have been a joke.
%
Mark: This zip... there's no pocket to this zip!
Sophie: So?
Mark: (So that's the way it is? Let's just put a zip here, a swastika there. 
Who knows what these things once stood for? Who the hell even cares?)
%
Jez: [To Sophie's father] He can't hear... Can you, you big fox-hunting, badger 
baiting, tweed-shirt bumfuck homophobe?
%
[to Jez, smiling smuttily]
Penny: Get yourself a nice tank of petrol. Come back soon.
Jez: (Yeah, right, so your husband can kill me and your son can worship my 
stuffed corpse and you can wheel me out for a fuck. No thank you.)
%
Mark: Please, no. Please tell me no.
Jez: What?
Mark: That. The smutty smile. Jeremy, please tell me that nothing's going on 
there.
Jez: Nothing is going on there.
Mark: Let's just say nothing's going on there.
Jez: Yeah. [Pause] Actually I did want to tell someone, I mean it was so cool, 
she had all this jam -
Mark: Oh my God, you didn't?! You fucked her! Jeremy, you need chemical 
castration, you're out of control! That's Sophie's mother!
Jez: She's hot.
Mark: She's not out of Hollyoaks, Jeremy, she probably had a ration book! Oh 
you're a piece of work aren't you? I'm down the pub putting the hours in with 
the dad, and you're back at the house banging the mum! That is not a good 
impression!
Jez: I dunno, I think I made a pretty good impression.
Mark: Jeremy, please, don't smile like that. You're not James Bond, you're 
disgusting.
Jez: (I am James Bond.)
%
[Mark has just twisted a bird's head off whilst hunting]
Sophie: Teas, coffees for the huntsmen.
Jez: No teas for the beastmaster, thanks. He feasts on the blood of his prey.
%
Jeremy: (Of course he's not allowed to shoot. He's Mark Chapman in the making 
and I'm very much a 21st century Lennon)
%
Mark: (He doesn't have anyone to talk to. He spends all day with the trees and 
animals. This is what happens when you live too far away from franchised coffee 
outlets)
%
Mark: (Ugh, "sir". This isn't Tennessee, Mark)
%
Mark: (Oh God, the first fiancé challenge and I've got a gun. An actual gun. 
It's OK, it's perfectly normal, this is the country. This is what farmers do. 
They go around shooting crows, and trespassers, and eventually, because of the 
EU, themselves.)
%
[after Mark is forced to spend an evening in a pub with Sophie's father]
Mark: (I barely have anything to say to my best friend, what am I going to talk 
to a fully grown man about all evening?)
%
Sophie: [to Mark and her father] Hey, nice to see you two getting on. What are 
you two talking about?
Mark: Oh, just...metal. (And the fact that I don't really love you)
%
Sophie: Bye. Love you!
Mark: I love you, too. (It's okay, everyone says it. I say I love Häagen-Dazs 
and my broadband provider, and I like Sophie more than them. In most respects.)
%
Mark: Hi, Alan, you wanted to talk about... oh!
Johnson: Don't be alarmed, Mark, it's just Tai Chi. Take a seat and I'll just 
power through. Should take 45 minutes, I'm done in ten. Stick that up your dojo.
Mark: Great.
%
Mark: (I do sort of like it when he's rude to me. Hopefully that's more of a 
psychological defect, not a weird sexual thing.)
%
Johnson: Tonight should be a free-fire idea zone. Watch a DVD, eat some pizza, 
fuck each other. I'm serious. Fuck a chicken if that's what it takes. Watch a 
chicken fucking a horse. What? You think the guys who invented Google sat 
around watching Trumpton?
Mark: (Oh he is good. Taboo busting, semi-incomprehensible pep-talk.)
%
Johnson: In business, Jeremy, you learn that every man has his price, and I 
judge yours to be... £530.
%
[about Indecent Proposal]
Jez: (Is this a terrible idea? It can't be. It's in a film. They wouldn't put a 
terrible idea in a film, they'd get sued.)
%
Big Suze: Sounds like you want to pimp me out.
Jez: Pimp me out. Pimp my ride. There's a new climate.
%
Jez: (God! I only asked her to be a hooker. It's not like I wanted her to work 
in telesales.)
%
Sophie: ...and I was quite shocked when you called Kathy a knucklehead, Mark.
Mark: No, I didn't.
Sophie: Yes, you did. You said she was a knucklehead and she should knuckle 
down or you'd knuckle her fat head. Then you stamped on Gerrard's foot.
Mark: That was an accident.
Sophie: No it wasn't.
Mark: But it could have been. I was careful to make sure that it could have 
been.
%
Mark: Sit down. Clear your tubes. 'Cause you and me are gonna chow down on the 
biggest hairy motherfucking business shit-storm since Enron.
%
Mark: (Suppose I can always roll Gerrard out for the sympathy vote. He's my 
dark secret... my elephant man.)
%
Mark: Oh right, so, now she's finished with you, suddenly you're in love with 
her again?
Jez: Exactly. Duh! That's how love works Mark.
%
Mark: (Oh great. I'm going out with literally the worst men in the world.)
%
Big Suze: Jeremy?! What the hell are you doing here?
Jez: Me? Oh. Nothing. I was just passing through... Kettering... And I thought, 
hey I know someone who's gone to Kettering for the weekend.
%
Jez: Look, Suze. Being black isn't about the colour of your skin. It's about 
vibe, hanging out, kicking back, smoking a number. Fighting prejudice and 
negative stereotypes wherever you find them! Yeah? I'm down with all that! Is 
Johnson? I mean, what's Johnson done for black people lately?!
Big Suze: You mean... apart from his mentoring and community work?
Jez: ...Yeah, apart from that!
%
Big Suze: You tried to sell my body! I don't want to talk to you. Goodbye
[Suze leaves, the Barman stares at Jeremy]
Jeremy: I did not try to sell her body. I tried to rent out her sexual organs 
[beat] on a one-use basis.
%
Mark: (Oh God. This is horrible. Ughh, she's touching the tube! That can't be 
hygenic...)
%
[While getting a lap dance in a strip club.]
Mark: (Oh, great! Here we go. I'm just another cock getting wired into the 
global economy. Uhhh, how should I look like? Bond-like neutrality? As though 
I'm so used to real-life naked women? Or, don't want to be rude... smiling 
encouragement? That's not a leer is it? Got to avoid the leer at all costs. And 
the dribble. Oh God, she looks amazing. This really should not be allowed. This 
is what men want and we shouldn't be allowed to have it because it's horrible 
and it make you feel sick! Oh great, now I'm getting an erection. How grimly 
predictable.)
%
Stripper: You should try and sum up all your aims in the first line.
Mark: Right, look, this is a very complex business proposal so I really don't 
think you could sum up all the aims in one line.
Stripper: If you can't sum up all the aims in the first line then they're too 
diffuse.
Mark: Look, my aims are not too fucking diffuse, ok?!
Stripper: Fine! Jesus! They just might be too diffuse. That was all I was 
saying...
Mark: (Great... Now I'm getting an angry lap dance... Brilliant...)
%
Sophie: And have I lived enough? I mean, I've only slept with four men. Is that 
enough?
Jez: Four?... Oh... Yeah. (Jesus. I've had sex with more men than that, and I 
basically only sleep with women.)
%
Jez: (This is almost definitely a terrible idea, but I won't know for certain 
until I've actually done it...[Jez and Sophie kiss]... No I was right, that was 
a terrible idea. That's probably the stupidest thing I've ever done in my 
entire life... Although... Maybe actually screwing each other will kind of make 
it weirdly better.)
%
[about Jez and Sophie being nice to Mark after he walked in on them almost 
having sex]
Mark: (Why are they being so nice? Maybe they've had a big chat about me and 
they're suddenly realised I was right about North Korea, I was right about the 
European Constitution, and by God I think I'm right about the congestion 
charge!)
%
Mark: You know what this piece of paper says, Jeremy?
Jez: Is it something to do with history? Have they stopped history books?
%
Mark: I'm about to walk into a boardroom gang bang and get fucked by the 
biggest swinging dicks in corporate strategy.
%
Jez: Maybe you should run away.
Mark: Right, thanks Jez.
Jez: Well, I mean, people say it like it's a bad thing, you know, running away 
from your problems. But if your problems never catch up with you, what's the 
hitch?
Mark: Right, well, in this case there would be repercussions.
Jez: What do you care? You'd be in the woods, playing the ukulele with the 
rabbits and the squirrels!
Mark: I suppose I could... run away.
Jez: Do it man!! (I think that was good advice... I mean, I didn't actually 
expect him to do it... Maybe I wouldn't have said it if I thought there was any 
chance of him actually doing it... But... yep, there he goes.)
Mark: (God, I'm running away! This is brilliant! Maybe I'll go to KFC and have 
a whole bargain bucket!Or join Al Qaeda!)
%
Jeremy: (Hiding out in a parking lot. He's not exactly Grizzly Adams)
%
Mark: (I've really done it this time. This isn't a late report or a misspelled 
memo. This is going feral. Rejecting society and living like an animal. That's 
not going to look good on my quarterly review)
%
Mark: (Right, here I go. Palms dry. Mouth dry. Inter-buttock area moist.)
%
Johnson: I'd just like to assure everyone that Mr. Corrigan will indeed be dead 
within a month.
%
Mark: I'm marrying her, what more does she want?
%
Jez: Mark, are you having some sort of mental breakdown?
Mark: I'm just joining the gym. Get some exercise, and some time... not away 
from Sophie, just... without her.
Jez: .....
Mark: You should join too. You get a free pen!
%
Mark: (Ugh, why did they have to put the bikes right in front of the 
sexualiser? Be so demeaning to get a bonk-on while exercising.)
%
Matt: Can you take some more? Can you? Do you want it? Do you want it?
Mark: NO!
Matt: What?
Mark: No, I don't want it, alright? Fuck off! You've made it too hard, I can 
hardly fucking pedal! No mountain is this hard, it's just not realistic!
%
Mark: (Ugh, that was horrible. Now he probably thinks I'm embarrassed about the 
size of my penis. When in fact, I'm not. I'm much more concerned about my 
misshapen scrotum.)
%
Jez: [after joining Nancy in the sauna] (Could use my sauna line.) Phwoor. Cor, 
it's like a sauna in here! [Nancy laughs] (Classic line. That is just a great 
line. Gotta manoeuvre more dates into saunas.)
%
Eva: [after being trapped in the flotation tank] I've got to get out. It was so 
dark! So dark!
%
Jez: Still, there are worse places to get trapped, right? I mean, you must be 
bloody relaxed by now!
%
Manager: Can you describe exactly what happened, Mr. Corrigan.
Mark: Uh.. Well, uh, h-he was... uh, g-giving me a m-massage. And, uh, h-he was 
going up my... legs and my thighs an-and then he... touched my penis... then he 
rubbed my... penis. Quite a bit. An-and I said "stop". But he wouldn't stop.
Matt: Mark why are you saying this? I don't understand.
Mark: B-because... because it's true.
Matt: Please don't do this! This is my career!
Jez: You should've thought about that when you were touching his cock.
%
Mark: (Maybe it would've been simpler just to kill him. I should know how to 
kill someone by now. I've watched enough CSI.)
%
Nancy: Matt, violence never solved anything: love thy neighbour as thyself.
Jez: Yeah, exactly; fuck off!
%
Matt: Well, you can't stay hiding there [behind Sophie and Nancy] forever!
Mark: He thinks we can't hide here forever.
Jez: He obviously doesn't know us at all, does he?
%
Mark: What a dud evening. Low quality take-away. Low quality detective drama. 
Low quality sexual intercourse.
%
Mark: Welcome to the world of work, Jeremy. You know, you don't have to be 
crazy to work here, but it helps.
Jez: And you don't have to be a smack-head to wank off old geezers, but that 
probably helps too.
%
Mark: (What should I say? Anything that doesn't mention wanking over your 
memory for the last twenty years would be good.)
%
Mark: (I thought she was a frightened little suburban mouse, but no, she's my 
nightmare: a liberated, sexually adventurous urban woman.)
%
Mark: If it ain't broke, don't fix it. And even if it is broke, just ignore it 
and maybe it'll be sort of OK. Like the environment.
%
Mark: Don't flaunt your wad, Jeremy. It's not becoming.
%
Mark: (What exactly is my plan here? I've lured them all to the safari park 
like a Bond villain, but what's the aim? Torture myself with contact with an 
unattainable woman?)
%
Mark: I can't believe it. He's actually thrown me to the lions.
%
Jeremy: You're disgusting. But I like it. Like going to a strip club with the 
Pope.
%
Mark: You gave him a hand?
Jeremy: Yeah.
Mark: Shit. (I knew it, I knew it, I knew it!)
%
Super Hans: Why didn't you tell me about the wanking-off bit?
Jez: Sorry, I didn't think.
Super Hans: Well you should've bloody thought. Jesus!
Jez: Did you do it?
Super Hans: 'Course I did. How do you think I got these trainers?
%
Nancy: What's going on? Who's wanking who off?
Super Hans: Jeremy's been wanking off this bloke for cash.
Jez: No I haven't! It's not -
Nancy: Jeremy, that is so you. I always knew you'd end up doing something like 
that.
Jez: What do you mean that is so me? That is not so me.
%
Jez: Cheer up, Mark. At least now you've got a funny story to tell people.
Mark: Yes. No, I guess this is a pretty funny story. (One that I'll never ever 
tell anyone because of my deep and burning shame.)
%
Mark: (Ugh... More data entry tonight. I guess the only good thing is that my 
life is so boring it feels like it might go on forever. Maybe I could put on 
Big Bond Themes and pretend I'm entering data for MI6.)
%
[with the relationship therapist]
Therapist: The sexual problems in your relationship?
Mark: Oh! Right. Are there...?
Sophie: Well, I just feel, I don't know, unfulfilled.
Mark: Unfilled?
Sophie: Unfulfilled.
%
Mark: (Oh great, so I'll be spending £1 a minute to hear how shit I am at sex, 
that's value for money!)
%
Jez: (This weekend is going to be one massive dry hump. Maybe the tension will 
build to the point where we actually try and fuck each other.)
%
Jez: Oh, that is great. You wouldn't even let me drink your piss. I'm not 
trying to kiss you, Mark. It's liquid waste.
%
Lucy: Can I get a metre of vodka...with an inch of tonic?
Mark: (Come on, Mark, turn it on! Play the game!) Oh, er, naughty, you've 
combined metric and imperial, you might get an interdenominational...er, you 
know, from mixing the two measurement systems, a hangover of that kind (Just 
stay mute, Mark. You're a social freak. Remain in your compound.)
%
Mark: (Oh, God, vodka! It'll be an orgy. Great! Disappoint three people instead 
of just one!
%
Mark: The whole world isn't Zoo Magazine, Jeremy. People don't just go around 
wanting it the whole time.
%
Jez: Warp factor 3 please, Scotty!
Mark: (Oh, great. I'm Scotty. He's off cross-breeding with the beautiful aliens 
and I'm stuck down in the engine room with the probably cancer-emitting fuel 
cells.)
%
Mark: (Oh my God! I've entered an interview situation and there's a hand near 
my cock. This is like that dream I had about Alan Sugar and the Badger.)
%
Mark: (This can't be real. They're probably Sophie and Johnson in masks and 
this is being paid for by MTV and the Playboy Channel.)
%
Jez: (If I don't think about it, there's always a chance it didn't happen.)
%
Jez: (I'll just throw it in the river like when I had my paper route. Screw 
you, Murdoch)
%
[discussing Malcolm's daughter]
Malcolm: What do you think of her? Honestly.
Mark: (I think she might have a borderline personality disorder.) I think 
she's... lovely.
%
Mark: I don't want sweet punani action; I want to take your bishop and grind 
you down!
%
[Mark is pitching his CV]
Mark: (Shit! I'm losing him!) And if you look at the bottom, you'll see that my 
hobbies include history and going to the movies.
Lucy: I like going to the movies.
Mark: (Of course you do. Everyone does. Man seeks woman. Must be interested in 
film, breathing oxygen and converting protein intake into muscle energy.)
%
Mark: (Fucking hell! He's got Mummy! He's brought a dead dog into my pitch, the 
stupid bastard!)
%
Jeremy: (I'm eating dog leg! This is definitely a new low.)
%
Jeremy: It's just a hairy turkey!
%
Jeremy: "Mummy" was probably the turkey's nickname. ... It could easily be!
%
[after Jez has eaten "turkey" (actually the dog, "Mummy")]
Mark: Did you actually have to eat it?
Jez: I don't know. I keep wondering that. But in the moment, it really did feel 
like I needed to eat it.
%
Jez: Did you slink off to bed before we did the melon-off?
Mark: I believe I did, and what exactly is....
Jez: Two guys get hard-ons, they put melons on their dicks, the first melon to 
fall off loses.
Mark: Right, and who won - Gore Vidal or Dr Jonathan Miller?
%
[Nancy is asleep on the sofa]
Mark: Nancy stayed over?
Jeremy: Yeah. Lovely, clean Nancy all over our filthy disgusting sofa.
%
Mark: (I'm not marrying out of spite, I'm marrying out of fear. There's a very 
big difference.)
%
Mark: (Need time to think. How can I buy some time? Contract TB? But where 
from? No badgers. Try to get beaten up? I could say he's got a... fat head. 
Call him a jizz-cock. It's not actually an insult, all cocks are jizz-cocks 
really; bit like calling him a piss-kidney.)
%
Mark: Well, you should be more careful you... jizz-cock!
Driver: What?
Mark: You could have had my legs off you... piss-kidney.
Driver: Arsehole!
Mark: (Arsehole! Yep, nice insult. Clean, clear and insulting.)
%
Jez: You OK?
Mark: Yeah, yeah, fine. Bit of a wobble. I just proposed to a woman in a coffee 
shop and tried to get myself run over.
Jez: OK. Right. That is maybe a sign that everything isn't totally groovy.
%
Jeremy: Mark we're in the middle of the road you're gonna get us killed for the 
sake of your legacy. Stop it! You're not fucking Blair!
%
Jez: (Am I actually going to piss on the church? It'd be quite a statement. 
Yeah, baby! Here I go. Richard Dawkins walks the walk but does he actually 
follow through with an actual act of piss?)
%
Jez: God I am dying for a piss. I feel like someone's inflating a balloon full 
of urine inside me. And not in a good way.
%
Jez: Let me go in that prayer bucket.
Mark: Prayer bucket?... [looking round] Jeremy, that's just a bucket.
Jez: Alright, I'm gonna creep up to the bucket...
Mark: No, you can't move!
Jez: Mark, I can't hold it in any longer! I'm busting!
Mark: Well, if you really can't hold it in, I guess you'll just have to...piss 
yourself.
Jez: You're ordering me to piss myself?
Mark: Yes, if you have to go, piss yourself.
Jez: Is this what it's come to?
Mark: Yes, and do it quietly!
Jez: And what shall I do after I piss myself? Fuck myself? Eat myself? [Jez 
begins pissing himself]
Mark: Are you going already?
Jez: Yes, I'm so pathetic, as soon as you ordered me to piss myself I started 
the procedure. See what you've done? You've ground down my sense of self worth 
over the years, I hope you're happy!
Mark: When are you going to stop?
Jez: Not for a bit.
Mark: Jeremy, stop! It's going down the crack!
Jez: Oh piss yourself, stop pissing yourself, it's not that easy Mark, the 
flood gates are open!
Mark: I'm ordering you to stop!
Jez: You're being a real dick about this, aren't you?!?!
%
Priest: ...Before God Almighty who knows all the secrets of our hearts...
Mark: (He's ladelling it on now. Is that in the proper thing or has he just 
added that to needle me?)
%
Mark: (Someone save me! Jeremy? Spacemen?)
%
Mark: (That's it. I've ruined my life! You only get one life and I've ruined 
mine!)
%
Mark:: (That's it. I'm alone. Tomorrow morning I'll wake up in my bed alone. 
Unless... I hire a prostitute. Just for the night. Kind of like a wedding 
present.)
%
Mark:: You know you really do smell quite strongly of piss.
Jez:: Yes, and your hat and shoe smell of puke, so I guess neither of us are 
exactly the king, are we?
%
Mark: So, Nancy, did she not show up?
Jez: No, she did ... with Super Hans, so that's nice. I think I might divorce 
her, see how she likes that.
Mark: Well, I suppose I should apologize for not letting you go and get her.
Jez: Yeah, I was pretty pissed off about that. But, I was thinking of waiting 
for a bit before I brought it up.
Mark: Oh, that's nice. Thanks man.
Jez: It's fine. I'll just chuck it in with all my other moldering resentments.
Mark: Exactly. Stick it on the bill.
%
Mark: (So unhappy. I wonder if anyone has ever been this unhappy while drinking 
champagne.)
%
Jez: Mark, double date tonight?
Mark: No...what's she like...is she sexy?
Jez: Mark, beggars can't be choosers. She's an actual woman.
Mark: It's too early, I'm not into it. No, I'm still technically married. I'm 
not safe to be reintroduced into society yet.
%
Jez: We might need to tidy up a bit. And we may have to untape the DVD and 
video and TV and Sky remotes
Mark: [disappointed] The Megatron? But....no
Jez: It smells wrong. I mean, the Megatron doesn't say 'urban freewheeelers', 
it says 'sofa masturbators'...y'know
%
Jez: Here we are. What are you doing?
Mark: Friends of the British Museum magazine. Clearly I'm not a Johnny Depp 
Tony Parsons Hunk of the Month, I need my props, I have my rituals.
%
Mark: (Jeremy was right; she's an actual woman.)
%
Mark: (Oh my God! I've already closed on a second date! This magazine is sexual 
dynamite!)
%
[Jez has just been told he may have Chlamydia]
Paula: Lots of times it's symptomless basically so it's just...
Jez: It's symptomless? Oh, right. So what's the biggie? I mean, no one minds if 
the invisible man comes to dinner. (Maybe I can get into this. Sexually 
transmitted disease. Sexually transmitted. Sexually. Sexy. I'm feeling sexy.)
Paula: You haven't noticed any unusual discharge from your penis, have you?
Jez: (Not so sexy.)
%
[Mark and Jez are on a double date at the theatre]
%
Jez: [whispering] When do we get to go out?
Mark: [whispering] As far as I can make out, we get to go out for a bit in an 
hour, then we have to come back for two hours.
Jez: You're kidding. I think I'll die.
Mark: If this was on television, nobody would be watching.
Jez: Oh God. Why aren't we watching television? [...] I've got Heat on DVD at 
home. We're watching this, when for less money we could be watching Robert de 
Niro and Al Pacino.
Mark: I'm going to pretend I am watching Heat.
Jez: OK. Let's just pretend we're watching Heat.
%
[Jez has left the theatre early]
%
Jez: (This is amazing. I wasn't meant to be out 'till eleven, and it's not even 
nine. I've time travelled. I've made time! I could do anything. I'm golden!)
%
[Whilst giving his ticket to a tramp]
%
Jez: Here you go mate. Go and see the second half. It's shit.
%
[Mark comes home to find the flat has been burgled]
Mark: Have you called the locksmith, have the police already been?
Jez: No, I thought I'd check with you first, coz, I mean what do you 
call?....or do you do it all online now?
%
Mark: The Playstation! The memory card! I'd nearly broken through on Medal of 
Honour. They've nicked 120 hours of quality me time! Bloody hell!!
%
[Apprehending the burglar]
Mark: (I'm wrestling with the white working class! Morse never did this!) Just 
shut up!! (I'm better than Morse!)
%
[On the phone to the police]
Mark: 45 minutes? But...I'm sitting on him. Is that legal?
%
Mark: Look, let's just try to continue our evening as if he wasn't here and if 
he tries to escape, I'll just have to take him down. (I've got balls like baked 
potatoes!)
%
[Holding up the Megatron]
Heather: What's this?
Mark: (Oh, the Megatron is shrinking my massive balls!)
%
Mark: [Right, you shit! It's mutually assured destruction!] Suze, I'm afraid I 
have to inform you that Jeremy has or may have a sexually transmitted disease. 
I'm sorry I had to tell you...
Jez: Mark! Shut up!
Big Suze: Is it AIDS?
Jez: Course it's not AIDS, this isn't the 80s. It's the best STD, just cute old 
mostly symptomless Chlamydia.
%
Mark: You know Jez... I've started to get this feeling that I'm totally, 
totally fucked... You know, I fucked up my wedding, I fucked up my only 
relationship. Everything's just completely fucked.
Jez: You have been thinking this for a while, haven't you?
%
Mark mentions he'd like to be a scout master. Jeremy smirks
Mark: What? You don't have to be a paedophile to want to work with children.
Jeremy: But it probably helps.
Mark: I spent five happy years in the scouts! And never once...
Jeremy: [Interupting] You told me kinky Leyton was all over you.
Mark: Yeah, alright Leyton was a bit of a paedo. But it was old style paedoing. 
Before it got such a bad name. (Of course, Leyton only ever really had eyes for 
Duncan Carpenter, the doe-eyed little flirt).
%
Mark walks past two of Sophie's friends. They stop their conversation and give 
him nasty looks
Mark: (Ugh.. the gossip mill. That's right, stare at Hess; throw fruit at Hess, 
pacing his prison yard!)
%
Jez: This is a chain-on scenario.
%
Mark: Mmmm. Why toast when you can roast?
Jez: Another roast? That's the third today.
Mark: What's nicer than a roast?
Jez: Yeah, but, chain-eating roasts?
%
Mark: Ugh no... Heartbreak Tuna! No, just bin it. But not literally - no need 
to be dramatic. Freeze it. See how I feel in six months.
%
Mark: If she wants a PR War, then she can have a PR War... I'll Mandelson her! 
Nobody wanted New Labour, Jeremy, but now we all know how it works.
%
Mark: [entering the office] (Walking into the jaws of death. Got to go past 
Sophie's desk. What I am going to say? Please save me, Jesus - I'll believe in 
you if you save me now ... The other way! She's looking the other way! Thank 
you, Jesus! ... Although it was fifty-fifty which way she'd be looking - might 
need a bit more to start believing.)
%
Mark: Mmmm, Piggin' Tea Break. Cup of piggin' tea and work out my piggin' 
campaign strategy.
%
Lisa: Erm, Mark, I just want to say about the wedding... that I think you're a 
real piece of shit.
Mark: Oh... OK. (That's fair. Lisa is a very fair person.)
%
Mark: Hi Soph, how are you? How are you feeling?
Sophie: Well... I want to give things another go.
Mark: You... you do?
Sophie: No, of course I fucking don't!
%
[Jeremy plays Barney's music to Super Hans]
Super Hans: Yeah, this is raw. Who is this, is this us?
%
Super Hans: Shit, he's done something there. How's he done that?
Jez: I think that what's happening is maybe two or three different musical 
things, at the same time!
%
Super Hans: Have you read the Big Beat Manifesto lately?
Jez: Did we write it down?
Super Hans: The Big Beat Manifesto goes "Big Beats are the best, Get high all 
the time".
Jez: Right. At the time, it felt like a much more all-encompassing philosophy.
%
Super Hans: I think this is probably the best example of the sort of stuff we'd 
do we've ever had.
Jez: Oh yeah. 'cause sometimes it's really hard actually to do your own ideas.
%
Mark: (Where do I sit... This must be what it's like being a nonce in prison.)
%
Mark: By the way, is it possible to get a block on a couple of e-mail addresses?
Dobby: Why, what have you been getting?
Mark: Ah, just the usual... crap.
Dobby: [reading] You're a piece of shit. Shitter, Stuff your bollocks up your 
gob...
Mark: It's just mates and that.
Dobby: [still reading] Fuck off and shut up and die?
Mark: Yeah they're pretty funny.
Dobby: Arseholes.
%
[after Dobby asks Mark to reach something high inside a closet room]
Mark: Ugh...you'll, you'll have to...move.
Dobby: Yeah, I should move, but...I might not move. [begins to rub her bottom 
against Mark's private area]
%
Mark: (This is possibly the most exciting thing that has happended to anyone 
ever. Does she know what she's doing? Is she just innocently waggling her bum 
around and I'm getting illegal benefit? I'm not doing a sexual assault am I? 
You can't do a sexual assault if you stay still like a statue. I'm just a 
statue, a dirty, filthy statue. Oh God, I'm getting very...Captain Corraghan if 
flying without a licence! Oh Jesus, it's too much, I'm going to blow my beans! 
I'm going to do a Chesil Beach!)
%
Mark: (I win because they all think I pissed myself, when they have no idea I 
came all in my pants!)
%
[about Jeremey's show in the club Fuckbunker, after Dobby seduced Mark earlier 
in a closet]
Mark: I just wondered if you fancied coming down with me to the Fuckbunker.
Dobby: Is that what you call the stationery cupboard?
%
Jez: (Hmmm... women. There they are, walking around. And they've all got them. 
Under their clothes. Hiding there. But I know the secret. Vaginas.)
%
Mark: (I've been caught out! Like Angus Deayton or Harold Shipman)!
%
Mark: This is piggin' massive!
%
Jez: What's going on?
Super Hans: Barney's locked himself in the bathroom.
Jez: What did you do to him?
Super Hans: Nothing...jesus...
Barney: He's a fucker!
Jez: Has he been sucking you off?
Super Hans: No! Of course not...
Barney: Yes.
Super Hans: Well...maybe once...
Jez: What the fuck are we going to do!?!? We don't know how to play his 
mu...our music. We're the frontmen! I was planning on just waving a maraca and 
giving the hotties my sex eyes.
%
Barney: I wanna go home. I wanna go home. I wanna go home. I wanna go home. I 
wanna go home. I wanna go home. I wanna go home.
Jez: What's going on?
Super Hans: He wants to go home.
%
Super Hans: [Discussing Barney] He's in a K-Hole right now, but in ten the 
speed'll kick in. Can a coke and a cig, he'll be right as rain.
%
Mark: Okay, what now? Go home and roast the shit out of some meat.
%
Mark: Look at us Jez, we're letting our lives slip through our fingers. Maybe 
you don't care, but I need to get out there. And I'm never going to meet a 
woman in a pub, or a nightclub, or an art gallery, or a bookshop, or any other 
formal or informal social gathering. Realistically it's just not going to 
happen.
%
Jez: (He's such a tight arse. Won't even replace the widescreen. How are they 
meant to brainwash me with their adverts if I can't see them properly?)
%
Mark: Recognise this, Jeremy?! I went to get the Cherry Garcia out to defrost 
and look what I found inside! [holds up a post-it note] "Look, I know what you 
think happened and yes you're right I have eaten all your ice cream." This is 
it. This is the line. You have crossed the line!
Jez: Read the mitigating circumstances. There are loads.
%
[Mark is making a list of everything that Jez can consume.]
Mark: Toilet paper, OK. Soap, OK. But not shower gel. And no razors. If you're 
poor, grow a beard. Tea Bags are allowed within limits.
Jez:Limits? What Limits?
Mark:No making a pie out of tea or anything weird
%
Mark: You ate your nest egg? You're meant to sit on your nest egg until it 
hatches, not eat it like some greedy, mad chicken.
%
Jez: It's not that easy Mark, there's just not that many jobs in the media. 
That's the reality.
Mark: Do something else. Get on your bike.
Jez: I can't believe you're making me get a job not in the media. You're such a 
bastard.
%

Mark: (Ugh, speed dating. That was horrible. No one else seemed to mind. Maybe 
this is the future. Three minute date, three minute fuck, three minute 
marriage.)
%
Mark: Ah, the results are in! What does the swingometer say?!
Speed Dating Hostess: Well, I'm afraid you've got no matches for dating...
Mark: What?!! None?! But number 23 said she was definitely going to tick! 
That's a verbal contract!
Speed Dating Hostess: Well, maybe you could take her to court
Mark: Yeah, speed dating! I'd be better off speed skating! (Doesn't really 
work. But she gets the point. I'm just another reject slowly slipping out of 
the gene pool to get hoovered up by the sex industry.) Ohhh, Saz, she implied 
she might be ticking. Maybe she did tick! Maybe the data wasn't collated 
correctly! Maybe she's my hanging chad

[To nurse at the sperm bank]
Jez: I just want to assure you that I am not the same as the rest of these 
feckless cumshedders. So if you ever need anyone for a private 
donation...you've got my details. (Urgh, bit creepy, the spermy atmosphere is 
cramping my style. Right, time to open my sticky bank account. Hey, where's the 
porn? No porn? Am I supposed to just dry hump myself? Must be something I could 
use. [Pulls out a £20 note] Would it be wrong? Why not? It's a free country)
%
Mark: I've been thinking ... it's been great having you here. But you've done 
the south now - the London Eye, the Trocadero - so you probably want to be 
heading up north. [...] There's a Harvey Nichols in Leeds that everyone goes on 
about, as if it's the answer to something.
Saz: Don't kick me out, Marco.
Mark: There's an ANZAC memorial in Huddersfield.
%
Jez: So that's what it comes down to, is it? You don't want to bone me, so I'm 
out - it's that brutal. Have you seen the old man, down by the seaman's 
mission? Yes - not very fuckable, is he?

Super Hans: It's a pisser though, innit - cancer. They should find a fucking 
cure.

Super Hans: Yeah, sure they are. They should pull their fucking fingers out. 
It's important, Mark.
%
Jez: Twenty thousand pounds. I'm going to be a millionaire!

Super Hans: Wow, nice. Nice gun. Must be, what, a... war gun.

Mark: (It's Paddy Ashdown. It's Indiana Jones. It's Indiana Ashdown!)

Mark: (Why doesn't Jeremy want you to be his dad? I want you to be my dad. I 
want to sit on your knee right now.)
%
Mark: (Good old Jeremy's mum. The more sophisticated end of the mum spectrum. 
The sort of mum you'd buy in John Lewis.)
Jez: Mummy, coffee, fucky hurry uppy.
Mark: (Whereas he's the sort of son you'd get free with Nuts magazine.)
Jez: Did you bring those CDs like I told you?
Jackie: Oh yes, they're in my handbag. Shall I fetch them?
Jez: Might be an idea. Oh, and guess what, you forgot to top-up my phone. Again.
Mark: Sorry, Jez, is there some reason why you're being so incredibly rude to 
your mum?
Jez Oh, right, stick up for mummy. You don't know her, Mark. You don't know her 
tricks. Anyway, what's it to you? Do you want to fuck my mum, is that it? Mum, 
Mark wants to fuck you.
Mark Shut up, Jeremy.
Jez He definitely wants to fuck you, Mum.
Jackie Stop showing off to Mark, Jeremy.
Jez Me? I'm not the one dressed like a prossy.
Mark: Please, Jez! This level of conflict may be usual for you, but it's not 
healthy - I'm going to have a heart attack!
Jez: Oh, and I suppose your relationship with your mum is healthy, is it? 
Sitting in silence watching Taggart. Thirty years of mutual resentment eating 
away at you.
Mark: We like Taggart. Even the new ones.
%
Martin: Do you write at all?
Mark: Well...I did once start a business book and I've always fancied doing an 
article about the evacuation of Greece in 1941 for the local paper. Not that it 
would really fit in with all the kebab shop stabbings.
%
Mark: (It's fascinating. Everything that can kill a man is fascinating... guns, 
electric chairs, paracetemol, lead piping)
%
Mark: You really do have to get over this thing with your mum - you're not 
Hamlet. Stop being Hamlet.
Jez: Well, all right, I'll stop being Hamlet when you stop being...
Mark: (He can't think of a Shakespearean character!)
Jez: ... a massive twat.
Mark: (Ha! He couldn't even think of Romeo! Romeo's easy!)
%
Mark: (This is great! Why was I anxious? I'm in my element. Older people are 
still people. They're just people who think when they open a new window on the 
computer the previous window has disappeared for good.)

Mark: (YES!!! No-one else I know would have found that funny, but I was right 
to think it was amusing!)
%
Mark: (I would literally stab a baby to do it!)

Jeremy's future happiness rests in my hands...And I've got a tiramisu. This is 
fucking amazing!)

Super Hans: Jez - can you tell me, yeah, as a mate, someone who knows me really 
well, is the bottom half of me on fire?
%
Super Hans: Come on Mark, don't piss on my strawberries.
%
Mark: (Is she straight? Gay? Doesn't bother me, just nice to know. It's not 
like I'm a homophobe. But it's good to know who you are. Stay safe. Praise the 
food, the lukewarm, disgusting food.) This food is superb.

Jez: How was the rest of your evening with Peaches Stalin?
%
Jez: It sounds like you've been raped, by a soldier, like in a Mike Leigh film.
%
Natalie: I tell you what, let's make this next one an Irish wine.
Mark: Well, what's an Irish wine? (Look at me, talking happily to a lesbian 
about war and Irish wine. Good job you're dead Norman Mailer cos there's a new 
Gonzo in town.)
Natalie: Whiskey usually makes me horny. It's a horny drink.
Mark: (When did we stop saying randy, I wonder. Horny has driven randy out)
%
Jez: Hello Natalie, how's your dad?
Mark: Jez, don't.
Natalie: Yeah, fine thank you.
Jez: Enjoying my money, is he? Is he lying in a bath of my money nude, after 
having sex with my mum nude?
%
Mark: (I'm having an orgasm against my will!)
%
Jez: You, my friend, are a rape victim. [...] Do you have feelings of guilt and 
shame, self-loathing?
Mark: You know I do - don't load the question!
%
Mark: It wasn't rape, alright? It was just a minor sexual assault. She didn't 
force anything up my bum - that's why it's not rape.
Jez: Well, it's not bum-rape, no.
Super Hans: Never said it was bum-rape, Mark.
%
Mark: (Maybe that was actually good sex? Loosen up, Corrigan - that's what 
happens in the bedroom now: no old fashioned fumbling and kissing, a lesbian 
rapes you whilst you dream about your mother. It's edgy.).

Mark: (Please don't shit on my dreams. I don't want shit on my dreams.)

Mark: War is never a picnic. Although obviously soldiers do end up eating 
outdoors a lot.

[Cally is signing up Jez and Super Hans' band]
Cally: Any questions?
Super Hans: Yeah, there are certain countries within the European Union that 
I'm barred from entering. You got a problem with that?
Jeremy: I'm a very sexual performer. Are you going to be able to handle that?
%
Jeremy: Wow, we've finally met the man. And the man is a woman. And he's hot!
%
Jeremy: Wow, this is definitely happening. Okay, got to focus. It's very 
important for my future career development that I give my manager an orgasm.
%
Mark: (Jeremy's getting a manager. I'm getting divorced. Maybe he'll end up 
happy and successful and I won't. That would be typical! I do everything 
society demands and die in a ditch, he sits on his arse an accidently shits a 
golden egg!)
%
Cally: It's so frustrating. There must be thousands of cash-rich and time-poor 
singles out there, I just don't have the time to meet them. I'm a gap in the 
market, somebody fill me!
Mark: (I'll fill you!! I love you, Cally! You are the one! Let's get married by 
Alan Sugar and live off all-butter croissants in Canary Wharf!)
%
Super Hans: We want to wallow in our own filth, Mark. Have a good old fucking 
wallow.

Super Hans: A suitcase with wheels? Real men don't get the earth to carry their 
luggage for them, mate. They carry it themselves.

Mark: (Well, err, I have been out with women...so I guess...)

go hand-in-hand. I bet if I got into defrauding pensioners, the pussy would 
really start rolling in.)

Cally: How could you possibly make one of these [crystal skulls] except by some 
type of magic?
Mark: In a factory...from glass.
Cally: Oh sure, c'mon! Could you make that?
Mark: No.
Cally: Could ANYONE?
Mark: Yes.
Cally: Look, Mark, this is important to me. If we're going anywhere, I need you 
to tell me that you believe in crystal skulls.
Mark: (Please don't make me believe in them.)
Cally: Do you believe?
Mark: I do believe in crystal skulls.
Cally: And what do you believe about them?
Mark: I believe that they were crafted by the ancient inhabitants of Atlantis 
and that they're powerful centres of healing.
Cally: There, that wasn't so hard, was it?
Mark: (Sorry science. Sorry Enlightenment. Sorry logic.)
%
[Mark and Cally are in bed after having sex together]
Mark: (Well, that was great. Apart from the skull sending out its invisible 
rays of bullshit, I think that might be my best ever sexual experience)
Cally: Okay, I think we have to have a talk. About the whole thing.
Mark: I'm sorry? The whole...?
Cally: The whole sexual experience. I have to say, that was very disappointing.
Mark: Oh, right.
Cally: I don't mean to be rude, but is that the kind of thing you usually do?
Mark: Well, I suppose, in general....what, what exactly did I do wrong?
Cally: Well, it was better than with Jeremy though. With Jeremy, I had to stop 
him in the middle.
Mark: You stopped Jeremy in the middle?
Cally: Sorry, is this weird for you, do you want to know?
Mark: [reluctantly] I do...a bit
Cally: He's like a red setter bounding after a tennis ball, you're like a 
captain solemnly going down with his ship.
Mark: Well, well that's good to know.
Cally: But we can try again, just as long as you're prepared for me to tell you 
exactly what to do?
Mark: That could be a good system.

Heat magazine with one hand down his trousers.)

to sell your soul to? It's his whole setup.

Jeremy: She's trying to shaft me, Mark! You've gotta dump her, it's a 
no-brainer.
Mark: It is not a no-brainer. I'll have to think about it. It's a brainer. It's 
a real brainer. See the thing is, I don't think I've ever done sex right before.
Jeremy: Oh, you're fine, mate. Stick with Missionary, you're a sexual civilian. 
Leave the disgusting stuff to me.
Mark: Cally's teaching me, she's giving me second-by-second detailed 
instructions of what to put where for how long
Jeremy: That's cheating! Anyone can please a woman if she tells you what to do. 
You're not allowed to ask, that's the whole point.
%
Jeremy: So, did Cally tell you about her and me...much?
Mark: No, no, God no. Don't worry, nothing like that. (She stopped him in the 
middle! I'll save that for a rainy day! That's money in the bank!)

Jeremy: (Christian security guard? What's he gonna do, excommunicate me?)

gut punch of pain and loneliness. Hello, old friend.)

Jez: Oh, hi Mark.
Mark: This may be the best day of my life! War with Sophie is over, and 
Johnson's given me a promotion! I've only got my own bloody little office.
Jez: That's great. Good for you.
Mark: (Uh-oh, the ghost at the feast, better take the mustard off.)
Mark: Well it wasn't that great. Lunch was pretty nothing-y. Baked 
potato...again...Are you, alright Jez?
Jez: I've just been doing alot of thinking.
Mark: (Oh shit.)
Jez: Why do I do half the stupid shit I do? I've been thinking, maybe I'm not 
in the one percent of people who think they're going to be famous musicians and 
are totally right. But, in the ninety-nine percent of talentless, misguided 
dickheads.

Mark: (I feel guilty about everything, from the pollution caused by Chinese 
industrialisation to not wearing some pairs of boxers as much as others. I'm 
sorry, stripey blue - you're just too tight.)

behaviour at all in her company. I really think she might be the one.)

it's because she's been smoking drugs... Good old drugs).

tower.)

for it back.)

won't be pregnant. It's not like I'm a Royal Marine with super sperm.)

pregnant.)

Sophie: I did three home tests last night and they were all positive.
Mark: Only three?

Mark: (Oh fiddlesticks. Of course, I'm having a baby. Great, I'll probably drop 
it or it'll grow up and write a bitter memoir about how distant I was.)

%
Mark: (Oh my God, I can't fire anyone. I'm like British Leyland in 1976.)
%
Jez: Are you angry?
Mark: You had sex with my wife, Jeremy!! That's quite a number, even for you. 
But then, on the other hand, I was definitely having a baby which, to be 
honest, wasn't really on my to do list for the year, so in a way, things are 
looking up.
Jez: Such a relief to tell you. It's been ever so weird ever since it happened. 
I've had this really bad feeling, like in my brain.
Mark: It's called guilt, Jeremy. Most people feel it quite a bit when they've 
done something wrong.
%
Jez: And...what about the...issue?
Mark: Oh, well, if Sophie continues down her path towards self destruction, 
we'll probably end up adopting like a couple of gay dads anyway. So there's no 
need to know whose it is.
Jez: Right! Who knows. Who the fuck cares!
Mark: Right. (Oh Jesus)
Jez: (Oh Jesus)

Super Hans: You should just get a van. With a van, it's like you've got an MBA,

Jeremy: Oh yeah, right, like there's a fire! There's never a fire, Mark, it 
just doesn't happen! I mean, maybe in a film, but...
Mark: So what? There's never been a fire, anywhere?
Jeremy: Not in an office, in England. God, you're pathetic! Ooh, fire! Please 
don't burn me or my posessions! I'm so important and flammable!

Jeremy: Mark, just because today was the first time you have ever, ever, EVER 
successfully arranged a date with a woman, does not suddenly make you Alfie, ok?

waiting to have all kinds of hardware plugged into it?

Jeremy: (Yeah! Russian men are probably all infertile! Thanks Chernobyl!)

Mark: Condom, condom, condom. Although maybe, two?
Dobby: Two condoms?

number. (I've got to tell her. I couldn't slide this in anyway. It'll be like 
trying to clingfilm an earthworm.)

never ever say that to her.)

terrifying, life-altering croissant-baby!)

Jez: Oh and I saw the porn she was looking at! Man, it's hot! She's got great 
taste, it was the most fantastic porn I've ever seen.

desperate world of pain?
%
Jez: I don't want to tempt fate, but I think everything is going to be totally 
great forever.

Jez: Always wipe, Mark. Discharge your pipe, then have a wipe. That's the rhyme.
%
Jez: Oh my giddy arse!
%
Jez: She's the one person for me, in the whole world.
Mark: Isn't it convenient that out of the approximately three billion adult 
women in the world, your one true love happens to live in the same block of 
flats as you, instead of in a village in Mozambique?

Mark: Why does everything have to be fun to be worthwhile? Crick and Watson 
have discovered the double helix. Did they do it on a skateboard? No? Well fuck 
off then, I'm not interested.
%
Sophie: Obviously it would be really great if you were happy but it's not the 
most pressing thing.
Mark: No... no, of course not.

Jez: Why do you have to bring worry and doubt into everything? You're like some 
kind of mad evangelist for anxiety!
Mark: (Lots to go around old son. I'm probably a few grams lighter now.)

Sophie: When our child looks up at you, I want them to see a happy, contented 
role model - not some grey faced, dull eyed drone who's hated his job and his 
life for years.

shield!?

Mark: I think we can count our friendship pretty much over from now on.
Jez: Oh, don't be a cock!
Mark: I'm not a cock, but the cock has certainly crowed... thrice.
Jez: When? What are you talking about?
Mark: It means you've betrayed me, it's the New Testament. You cock!
%
Mark: I don't think I wiped off that porn you recommended.
Jez: I didn't recommend it Mark. I'm not Timeout.
Mark: Yes you did - you gave it five stars!
%
Mark: That's the single nicest thing Jez has ever done for me and it's 
completely ruined my life.
%
Jez: It's a great boiler, it's just got a very idiosyncratic control panel. 
It's like the Jesus and Mary Chain of central heating control systems, 
difficult to get into initially, but then- so much to explore!
%
Jez: So you'll buy tissue paper for me to wipe my sphincter, but you won't buy 
a bit of lube to aid the giving and receiving of pleasure?
Mark: That's right.

Elena: Gail’s in Mensa. She reads books. For fun!

Jez: I'm freezing. Could you throw me a rope?
Mark: I haven’t got a rope.
Jez: What do you mean, you haven’t got a rope?
Mark: I don't own a rope! I don't own a boat, or any cattle, or any of the 
things that ropes are useful for. What the hell would you do with a rope, 
anyway?
Jez: Climb up it!
Mark: Oh, sure. Climb up it, using your strength.
Jez: Well, you could pull me up.
Mark: Yeah, I could haul you up using my muscles.
%
Jez: (What a bastard! Destroys my perfect love just because it's built on lies!)

Mark: It'd be like picking off bystanders with a sniper rifle: fun at first, 
but it would quickly become a depressing chore.
%
Johnson: Suze! Have you seen the big scissors? Have you moved the big scissors?
%
Jez: Even a dried up, dessicated old branflake on toast like you should be able 
to see that!
Mark: (If I’m a branflake, he’s a slutty Sugar Puff!)

need another bullet in the head...okay? Righty righty!
Mark: (I made his bed and got his tea, I am his wife!)

Jez: I am so proud of you. There was everyone thinking you were just this 
fusty, sweater-wearing, spirit-crushing no-fly-zone with ten foot carrot up his 
ass.
Mark: Yeah, obviously it is only a tactical party. I'm only having a party to 
eventually get sex.
Jez: This is only reason anyone in recorded history has had a party Mark!
%
Mark: (Oh god this could be a disaster. I want a night of edgy banter and tipsy 
indiscretions, he wants us all lying around in our pants flinging shit at each 
other.)
%
Jez: Big of you, inviting him.
Mark: I thought it would look petty and vindictive not to, and as a petty and 
vindictive individual I have to take extra care not to appear petty or 
vindictive.

Mark: I need to get Gerrard incredibly fucked. Booze, drugs, whatever.
Jez: Chemical castration; classic.

Jez: Will you excuse me? I've got to go and give that ill-looking man an 
enormous drink.

Mark: Only downside is no Dobby. If it peaks before Dobby gets here, I've 
wasted good party.
Jez: Maybe call her? Give her some flavour.
Mark: What, like start a message and then say "Stop it Julio. Get your own 
cocaine, I've got too much tit in my mouth."?
Jez: Exactly
%
Jez: Oh god, Elena.
Mark: ....
Jez: This is not all my chickens coming home to roost, Mark, all right? Don't 
stand there thinking it is.

roost-a-thon.)

Big Suze: Mark - there's something wrong in the loo.
Mark: (God, she looks like she's witnessed a war crime.)
%
Super Hans: All right Jez.
Jez: Yeah, um, just an idea, would it be okay mate if you fucked off before I 
ram a wine bottle up your cock?
%
Mark: Dobby, Come in. No need to explain what the hell you've been doing till 
this time.
%
Mark: Dobby mustn't see Gerrard. He's gone over the edge of reason. Get rid of 
him!
Jez: Aye aye, captain.
%
Jez: Gayle. Great you could make it.

Gayle: Thanks!
Jez: (Come on in to your emotional torture pit.)
%
Sophie: What days do you want, Mark?
Mark: (I don't know, Easter and Shrove Tuesday?)
%
Jez: (She's so suggestable, like a sexy robot anybody can hack into and 
program. Oh there it goes, lesbian kiss - and no one minds! Where are all the 
homophobes when you need them? God, people are so fickle.)
%
Mark: (Great. Gerrard gets Dobby and I get a pukey bucket of snake.)
%
Jez: (Oh what a disaster. Love is all you need. No, actually, Beatles. You also 
need a person to do it with; Beatles.
%
Mark: (God she's huge. It's like Alien, if the alien was a human. Hmm, If I had 
to choose would I rather an alien burst out of my chest quickly, or was heaved 
out of my vagina slowly?)
%
Mark: (He'll never be a lad.Boy to geek to drone.Thats the Corrigan trajectory)
%
Mark: Sophie? Jeff says the baby's a boybe. Is it a boybe?
Sophie: Yes!
Mark: Right... almost makes it seem real.
Sophie: Well it is real.
Mark: Of course. (Totally doesn't feel real. maybe 1% more real now)
%
Sophie: I've been thinking about names, have you been thinking about names?
Mark: Soph, it's early doors yet, we've a month and some weeks to go (I can get 
to Argentina in a month. Argentina and a face transplant?)
Sophie: I was thinking 'Tarquin Oliver Nimrod'.
[Mark bursts out laughing]
%
Sophie: What would you call him? Mark? Mark Mark Corrigan III?
Mark: No! Of course not, something... normal.
Sophie: What's normal?
Mark: I dunno.. Bruce, or something.
Sophie: Bruce!?
Mark: No, not Bruce.
Sophie: Did you just say Bruce?
Mark: No, I didn't mean Bruce, just a name in that area.
Sophie: Little Bruce?
Mark: No, not Bruce. Just a name like Bruce, not even that much like Bruce!
%
Mark:(I'll stick with My high fat foods which will eventually kill Me and My 
play which is obviously never gonna happen)
%
Jez:(This would be so much easier if She wasn't a person with hopes and dreams 
and grasping clinging Arms)
%
Mark:(Its great being a wedding guest.You get to be an unpaid extra in the 
climactic scene of someone else's Rom-Com)
%
[Sophie hands Mark an envelope]
Mark: (Hate mail? In person?!)
%
Mark: The absolute worst thing anyone could say about you is that you were a 
selfish, moral blank, whose lazy cynicism and sneering, ironic take on the 
world encapsulates everything wrong with a generation. But you my friend are 
not evil.
%
Mark: Killing your enemies is a simple solution. Probably why in ethics and law 
it's so frowned upon
%
Jez:(No milk. Not black tea. I'm not some kind of monster!)
%
Jez: Zara says we have only one thing to fear, and that's fear itself..It's a 
clever saying, isn't it?
Mark: And what about losing all your money, or shitting yourself in public, or 
the tabloid press mistakingly outing you as a paedo or Alzheimer's patient, or 
all of those things plus you're drowning?
%
Mark:(He brings the insufferable music and then leaves. He's like the 1980s.)
%
[Mark on Caesarian section]

pin, not London Dungeon!)

Mark: (Never go to war with Stalin, Gerard. Uncle Joe doesn't play by your 
rules.)
%
[Supporting the woman whose partner is in a coma]
Jez: We need to get you some answers. Is he going to pull through? You need to 
know. (I need to know. Right now I'm the supporting character in a weepy when I 
want to be the leading man in a porno.)
%
Mark: [Watching Jeremy try to read Wuthering Heights] (Fascinating. It's like 
watching a sheep try to use an iPhone.)
%
Jez: Why do they have these brushes anyway? Who wants brushed post?
%
Mark: Jeremy, do you think we could take a brief time-out from the 
masturbate-athon that is your life, to go to my son's christening?
%
Mark: Where's the turkey, Jeremy?
Jez: What?
Mark: The turkey. Where's the turkey?
Jez: I thought you were getting the turkey.
Mark: You what? No turkey?! You fucking idiot, Jeremy! You total fucking idiot! 
That was YOUR job, you fucking moron! You CRETIN! You're a FUCK-HEAD! That's 
what you are! A fucking SHIT-HEAD!
Jez: (calmly) It was a joke, Mark. I was joking.
%
Jez: I'm a Christmasist.
%
Mark: I would have found that funnier if I hadn't been literally weeping in 
fear.
%
Jez: Not the Hootenanny! Never the Hootenanny! We're better than that.
%
Jez: (We could be the Chemical Toilet Brothers.)
%
Mark: (So great that Dobby's agreed to move in. Just gotta close the deal. Get 
her into the flat and keep her locked down like Fritzl. No, not like Fritzl, 
like a nice normal loving guy who knows where she is at all times. Which at no 
point would be locked in the cellar.)
%
Jez: Jeff?!
Mark: I think it's okay. Or do you think there's any chance he's trying to kill 
all of my offspring. Like Herod.
%
Dobby: Oh, Jez, Mark told me about you burning the band. Are you okay?
Jez: Yeah. I'm too big to fail.
Mark: He doesn't know what that means.
Jez: I do know what that means.
Mark: (He doesn't know what that means.)
%
Mark: (What if I broke the microwave? Test case: if she buys a new one I know 
she's never moving in.)
%
Mark: (Yes Gerrard, but there's a sting in the tail, a scorpion in the Kinder 
Egg, a nail in the Toblerone, and… 'tis I.)
%
Mark: (Maybe Ian won't remember I gave him away to another man. If he does, 
he'll be some kind of memory genius. Yeah, my son hates me, but he can remember 
a full deck of cards and that's why he lives in Vegas.)
%
Jez: I've always got the Three 0h Walcott millions.
Mark: Jeremy's planning to sell the headline "Three Oh Walcott" to a tabloid 
newspaper when Theo Walcott turns thirty, and we've agreed not to argue whether 
that's a good plan.
Jez: It is a good plan.
Mark: I know.
%
Jez: (Right, therapy. What do I really want from therapy? A harsh, unremitting 
stare at the bare facts of my actual life. Ah, fuck that, he's eating a Twix! I 
can't take him seriously.)
%
Mark: (Hang on, this is prime therapy time. Oh I get it, the lady doth eat 
bhaji too much, methinks. I've seen behind the curtain. Ahoy there, moral high 
ground. He's wasting five hundred of my pounds, and it feels fantastic!)
%
Mark: What did he die of?
Dobby: Flu.
Mark: He died of flu? Hey, Jeremy, Gerrard's died of flu.
Jez: Bull-shit
Mark: Seriously.
Jez: Bloody hell, that is SO Gerrard.
Mark: I know.
Dobby: He had a weak immune system Mark.
Jez: He had a weak everything, to be fair Dobs.
%
Mark: (The reproachful, but still quite irritating, voice from beyond the 
grave.)
%
Mark: (Funeral parlour, massage parlour - those are the main parlours, aren't 
they? What's the link, both lying down? Except, pizza parlour?)
%
Mark: (Interview then funeral, the ultimate combo. Minicab waiting, same outfit 
for both.)
%
Mark: (This is a mega-funeral. It was a mega-interview. Hugh was the only real 
rival, but look what's happened to Gerrard. This is what I do to rivals, I put 
my rivals in the ground.)
%
Mark: (Well played Gerard, you couldn't beat me on Earth so now you're shitting 
on me from heaven, like a dead jealous pidgeon)
%
Mark: (This must be the greatest quantity of squeezable mustard ever present at 
a literary lunch.)
%
Jez: Look, I'm just going to say this. I love you Celia. (So great for a first 
date. Stone cold classic.)
%
Celia: That is so true.
Jez: (Of course it's true. I just made it up.)
%
Mark: Robert, is Super Hans my boss now? Have you just promoted him?
Robert: Well that depends how you define "boss".
Mark: In the normal way?
Robert: Then yes, he is.
%
Super Hans: I'm guessing: cat
Mark: (Yes, and this cat's going to help me lure Dobby in, like a classic 70s 
paedo with a Ford Grenada.)
%
Dobby: We will do this for real, right? We will go interrailing?
Mark: (Ohh, she's insatiable. I don't want to sleep with strangers in hostels 
and never have a proper relaxed poo.) Yeah, sure.
%
Jez: I've got medical training, I've got a certificate.
Mark: I gave you the certificate. It's utterly meaningless.
Jez: In a way, aren't all so called qualifications meaningless?
%
Mark: (Wow, you're like a sexy, human, Duncan Bannatyne.)
%
Mark: (Am I expecting to have adulterous sex with Stephanie? I don't know. I 
did put my nice pants on. But then I also wore those to the Jubilee pageant)
%
Mark: (What can I get away with before it's sure-fire infidelity? A kiss on the 
lips? Some people say hello like that. Touch the waist? Another innocent 
greeting gesture. As long as she doesn't rub my penis. No-one says hello like 
that, other than in prison.)
%
Jez: (You're not letting me steal your girlfriend you total bastard.)
%
Jez: (Good old fate. It does the hard work so you don't have to. Or am I 
thinking of flash?)
%
Mark: Well, me and Dobby make a great team... Opposites attract!
Jez: No they don't. Not really. That's just something scientists and people in 
horrible relationships say.
%
Mark: I'll kill you, Jeremy, for trying to steal Dobby, and electrocuting me, 
and destroying my fucking pie!
