[On the subject of Adam and Eve]
Stephen Fry: But perhaps, you know, we should believe in Adam and Eve. Geneticists have established that every woman in the world shares a single female ancestor who lived a hundred and fifty thousand years ago. Scientists actually call her "Eve", and every man shares a single male ancestor called "Adam". It's also been established, however, that Adam was born eighty thousand years after Eve. So the world before him was one of heavy to industrial-strength lesbianism, one assumes.

[After a question concerning Burmese etiquette]
Stephen Fry: While double-checking this … on the Internet, we came up with the extraordinary information that it's considered polite to express joy by eating snow and to send unwanted guests away by biting their leg, and normal behaviour to wipe your mouth on the sofa. This is actually true, the researchers were writing this down with great excitement about Burma, only to discover in the end that Burma turned out to be the name of a poodle belonging to the author of the website.

Jeremy Hardy: "Blue moon, I saw you standing alone". Not "with a small friend".
Rich Hall: So why is there, uh... why is there not one romantic song with the word "Cruithne" in it? Why not "Blue Cruithne of Kentucky", or "Cruithne River", or--
Alan Davies: No one can see it--
Stephen Fry: BECAUSE IT WAS DISCOVERED IN NINETEEN-NINETY-FUCKING-FOUR!
Rich Hall: 9 years! 9 years to write a romantic song with the word ‘Cruithne’ in it.
Stephen Fry: In the last 9 years, no romantic songs, as far as I know, have been written at all. Have they?

Stephen Fry: [about woodpeckers' tongues] How does it fit into its mouth, you may wonder? Well, it has to wrap it round its brain and the back of its eye sockets. Funnily enough, woodpeckers are very popular on creationist websites, because they argue that this is such an extraordinary creature designed so fit for its purpose, and so on, that only a designer could have made it, it couldn't have evolved. Apart from everything else, when it moves, sometimes up to fifteen or sixteen times a second it beats the wood to make a hole, which is incredibly fast and generates immense forces—two hundred and fifty times more forces than an astronaut is subjected to. It's a thousand Gs. And it has these extraordinary kind of little muscles and cartilages around its brain to stop it from shattering. [suddenly laughs] If the pecker's got wood, why go for tongue, you may argue! Um … [giggles as everyone stares at him] … but it is pretty astonishing …

He's now said, "Even if you can't see it or it's on the other side of the world, they still use it." And these bees are thinking, "No, we don't! We just remember where we live!" Why is it so remarkable that they know where they live?
Stephen Fry: … Well, because they have only 950,000 neurons, as opposed to our 10,000,000,000 neurons in our brains.
Alan Davies: But they've only got one thing to remember—where they live.

Stephen Fry: People believing in manna doesn’t really upset me or anybody sensible as much as, say, than believing—
Alan Davies: I don’t eat meat, right? I don’t eat meat, and someone actually said to me, someone who should remain nameless, really angrily: “Animals were put on earth for us to eat.” What does he mean by that? Put by whom?
Stephen Fry: That’s silly. Off course that’s silly.
Alan Davies: I said: “You can eat one if you want, but don’t shout at me about them being put there like it’s some big toy farmyard.” You are really clever, why do they believe it all? Can’t they just go: “Bwooh, that was mad, I thought that was true for a minute.” Why do people believe it?!
Stephen Fry: Because they are foolish and ignorant and scared.
Alan Davies: They need to believe it? Do they need to believe it?
Stephen Fry: There is a distinction to be drawn between those who claim to have access to revealed truth and therefore claim to know what happens to us after we’re dead on the basis of a text, whether it’s a Quran or a Holy Bible.
Alan Davies: But why do people believe them?
Stephen Fry: Which is nonsensical. And if they want to believe it, they’re fine, but they mustn’t push it down our throats and they mustn’t tell me whom I’m allowed to go to bed with and whom I’m not allowed to go to bed with. It’s not acceptable. Anybody who tells me what happens after I’m dead is either a liar or a fool, because they don’t know.
Alan Davies: That is what I mean! I don’t mind—
Stephen Fry: The myth of the Jewish people having manna dropped on their heads, that doesn’t actually matter. That’s no more different — that’s like Greek myth or any other myth, that’s fine. It’s when it gets to telling people how to behave is where we do draw the line.

Stephen Fry: No! Give me that luffa.
Alan Davies: Now you want it.
Stephen Fry: That's going in the art cupboard and you're going in the naughty corner.
Rich Hall: It's going in your penis tin isn't it?
Stephen Fry: You are very bad children indeed.

Jeremy Clarkson: Did you know a veal has to have more space to be transported to the abattoir than a human being in the back of an aeroplane.
Sean Lock: ...yeah, but to be fair, we have a holiday, they get killed.

Jeremy Clarkson: I had a puffin last week, that's not delicious, but the point of eating it was because I never had one before...
Sean Lock: ...have you tried one of my turds?
Stephen Fry: Did you just say what I thought you said? Get out. Out now.
%
Jeremy Clarkson: D'you know what I had for my starter when I had the whale?
Stephen Fry: With grated puffin?
Jeremy Clarkson: I had a seal flipper, and it looked exactly like a marigold glove filled with wallpaper paste. And it sat and you thought, "Ooh …!" And it tasted exactly like licking a hot Turkish urinal.
Sean Lock: I'm very concerned that you used the word "exactly"...
%
[looking at the aries star sign]
Stephen Fry: Ah, there we are. It's some sort of goat. It's a goat waiting to be fucked from behind.
Sean Lock: It's a provocative goat.
Stephen Fry: Quite clearly a Greek goat.

Alan Davies: If you ask a lady for directions, she’ll ask you a question back. So if you say “do you know where the post office is?”, she’ll say, “do you wanna buy a stamp?”
Stephen Fry: Sweet.
Alan Davies: And you’ll find you’re having a nice chat, and everyone’s friends, but you’ve no idea where the post office is.

Phill Jupitus: Wouldn't it be great if you walked into a pub with him, though … [points at Stephen] … with Fry on your team? "Yeah, this is Barry from down the road. Yeah, he does look like him." And Fry would be there having to fake it in the pub—"Oh, blimey!"
Bill Bailey: Giving it away by swearing in Latin!

Stephen Fry: Who is this?
Alan Davies: Eros.

Stephen Fry:Well, thank you for falling into our little heffalump trap there. It’s actually the Angel of Christian Charity.
Alan Davies: Eros.
Stephen Fry:Eros was the Greek god of love. This is the Angel of Christian Charity.
Alan Davies: Why is it called Eros, then?

Stephen Fry: Anyway, Celtic nations but especially Caledonia are rightly praised for their creativity, so name three Scottish inventions.

Clive Anderson: Well, the television is always the one that's sort of claimed...

Stephen Fry: [After revealing that neither Television, Haggis nor Whiskey was invented in Scotland] Scottish inventions and discoveries include: Adhesive stamps, the Australian national anthem, the Bank of England, bicycle pedals, the breach-loading rifle--you'll notice I'm going in alphabetical order--Bovril, the cell nucleus, chloroform, the cloud chamber, cornflower, a cure for malaria, the decimal point, the Encyclopedia Britannica, fountain pens, fingerprinting, hypnosis, hypodermic syringes, insulin, the kaleidoscope, the lawnmower, lime cordial, logarithms, lorries, marmalade, matches, motor insurance, paraffin, piano pedals, the postmark, pneumatic tyres, RADAR, the reflecting telescope, savings banks, the screw propeller, the speedometer, the steam hammer, raincoats, tarmac, teleprinters, tubular steel, typhoid vaccine, ultrasound scanners, the United States Navy, universal standard time, vacuum flasks, wave-powered electricity generations, and wire rope!

Stephen Fry: Oh, there it is. We know that’s what you were thinking.

Stephen Fry: I leave you with this cautionary snippet about paying attention. A radio interviewer from GLR radio carried away with news of a possible discovery of a cross between an elephant and a woolly mammoth, asked a palaeontologist "so it'd be like some sort of hairy gorilla, would it?" To which the palaeontologist replied "Yes, pretty much! Except elephant shaped. And eh, with tusks."

[On treating phobias]
Phill Jupitus: So I'll have to get into a bath full of spiders?
Jo Brand: You can do it two ways. You can do a graded desensitization, where you're gradually exposed to spiders, or you can do something called flooding, where you just get chucked in with them.
Stephen Fry: This is cognitive therapy, isn't it?
Jo Brand: Well, it's more sort of behavioural therapy really, because it's cheap.
Phill Jupitus: I think I'll settle with just screaming like a girl and running around the house, if that's alright with you.

[On the subject of cockfighting]
Stephen Fry: [reading from a card] It says here a good cocker would think nothing of cleaning his cock's wounded head by sticking it in his mouth and sucking it clean.
[The audience laughs and Clive murmurs in agreement.]
Phill Jupitus: You're watching QI for the Straight Guy!

[On the original story of Cinderella]
Stephen Fry: The original stories were quite gruesome. When the ugly sisters tried to slip into the slipper, they cut off their toes and their bunions to try and squeeze in, and the slippers filled with blood.
Jo Brand: They probably got that idea from Trinny and Susannah.
%
Stephen Fry: What I want you to do first is tell me all about the twelve Frenchmen and the twelve mosquitoes.
Dara Ó Briain: Once upon a time, there were twelve Frenchmen called... 'Appy, Sleepy, Arrogant, Furieux, Un Chose Comme Ca, Bof and Zut Alors. And...
Phill Jupitus: That's six!
Dara Ó Briain: Fenètre, Boulangerie...
Alan Davies: Le Table.
Dara Ó Briain: Le Table, of course. And Jambon et Fromage, the twins. And they used to travel around with mosquitoes...
Phill Jupitus: And what were the mosquitoes called?
Bill Bailey: Buzzy, Stingy...
Dara Ó Briain: It was a very, very low-rent 1950's French detective series, that involved, at some point, the extraction of a tiny amount of blood from one of the suspects.

Stephen Fry: When the Titanic sank, what was the first thing that happened to the crew?
Phill Jupitus: Terrible luck for them, but they actually had their six-month review...
%
[On what happened to the crew of the RMS Titanic]
Stephen Fry: Every single member of the crew had their wages stopped at the moment of the sinking. The moment a ship sinks, it is not a ship, therefore you can't work on it, therefore the White Star Line paid them up to the minute of the sinking.
Phill Jupitus: I would imagine that in a sinking situation, you'd hope to be getting time and a half.
%
[On the Titanic]
Phill Jupitus: Is it true that someone dressed as a lady to escape detection?
Stephen Fry: Yes, apparently it is true, because it was women and children first.
Bill Bailey: [chuckling] I thought you said "someone dressed as a baby".
Phill Jupitus: [posh accent] "Yes, goo-goo indeed. I have a lollipop and I have no control over my urinary functions. I am, in fact, an infant. And I know you think I'm Lord Albemarle, but I am in fact a little baby. With a beard. Yes, goo-goo, gaa-gaa. And madam, may I tell you I've been a very naughty baby?"

Arthur Smith: D'you know what you should drink with the beating heart of a cobra? This is a dish in China where you get a cobra—and it's brought to the table alive. They then slice it open, rip the heart out, and it's beating on the plate there—you have to chase it round the plate, I s'pose—and then you drink the blood of the snake as the wine.
Clive Anderson: Actually, I ordered the lasagne …

Arthur Smith: I had occasion to hire a theatrical duck, once …

[on the differences between cats and dogs]
Liza Tarbuck: Cats mating, it can be a quite exclusive little gang, whereas dogs, they can run riots, so you could have a Great Dane with a Chihuahua.
Stephen Fry: It's a nice image.

Stephen Fry: What comes before a German Bight?
Neil Mullarkey: [presses buzzer] A German Bark.

Stephen Fry: Name, if you can, the subject of the three volume book whose first volume is entitled "The Long Years of Obscurity."
Phill Jupitus: The career of Phil Collins.
Ronni Ancona: Is this book about the word obscurity before it got famous? How it was beaten by its adjective father. And left on the doorstep abandoned by its mother, and it was the only noun growing up in a house of verbs. And the verbs were always going out doing lovely things, because they were doing words, and poor old obscurity was stuck inside suffering from asthma. And then after school it was surrounded by quotation marks and got beaten up terribly. And then one day entered into reality TV show and it became very famous and it was much in demand and used to describe all the people who leave Big Brother House?
%
Rory Bremner: They built the station next to the power station you see there, which is the third worst eyesore in the country. It was a Country Life thing—do you know what the first one was?

Ronni Ancona: A lot of people say that they're smarter than people, but if they were, wouldn't they be saying that?

Ronni Ancona: It's so weird that these national heroes are not from the place they are supposed to be. William Wallace was from Kenya. His mother was Masai... Not really!

Stephen Fry: So, Culloden was really more of a local difficulty; it was Highland versus Lowland; it was like Celtic and Rangers. Catholic versus Protestant, essentially. It's that kind of fight. And it goes on to this day. Will we never learn? Who knows? Religion. Shit it.

[About alcohol]
Alan Davies: Does it affect memory? Cos I’m fairly sure it does.
Stephen Fry: I did know that.
Alan Davies: Cos on my 30th birthday, I got some photos back after we had this dinner, and there were people with indoor sparklers. And I thought, “when did they have them? I must have gone to the loo or something. I don’t remember that.” And the next one was me with a sparkler. Then it’s me with two sparklers. Me lighting sparklers really intently, handing sparklers out.

[About Derren Brown]
Johnny Vaughan: He's got one great trick. You know when you've got an empty seat by you in a train, and you don't want anybody to sit there? He says you're insane to put things on the chair to stop people sitting there. The trick is, as they approach, you smile at them and pat the seat.

Stephen Fry: The word "donkey"—when did it come into the English language?
Graeme Garden: When was Don Quixote published?
%
Mark Steel: You know what they say is a test of whether you're anal? Whether or not you keep your records in alphabetical order. I would surely think that it depends on how many records you got—I mean, if you've only got two and you keep going back and going "ABBA, ZZ Top, they're still there, that's lovely" but I've got a roomful of bloody records! I keep them in alphabetical order so I can find the one I want! Apparently that means I got a problem with me arse! How is that right?
%
Stephen Fry: What is meant by the expression "hoover the talking seal"?
Roger McGough: Well, it's either one of those wonderful Oz expressions for throwing up … "Excuse me, I've got to go hoover the talking seal …"
Stephen Fry: Or "My wife came in just as I was hoovering the talking seal …"
%
Roger McGough: [reciting a poem] A crab, I'm told, will not bite,
Or poison you just for spite;
Won't lie in wait beneath a stone,
Until one morning out alone,
You poke a finger like a fool
Into an innocent-looking pool;
Won't grab your hand
And drag you off across the sand
Down into the bottom of the sea
To eat you dressed for Sunday tea.
The crab, I'm told, is a bundle of fun.
With claws like that? Pull the other one!

%
[Stephen has said that you get a better clean on a knife blade if you have it pointing up in the cutlery rack of a dishwasher.]
Phill Jupitus: I clean my knives in a crossbow. Some people say it's foolish. I put them in the hoover and set it on blow, and then shoot them and trap them around the kitchen, as I sit with a plug, bare-wired, at my feet, peeing on it! Gives it a better clean...

[on having to replace a door]
Alan Davies: The door handle kept turning like that, and I really needed to go, so I kicked the door in. It's the only time I ever kicked a door in. Brilliant! And it was a really cheap, flimsy door, and it smashed [gestures] like that and it exploded, and the door bit fell down, and there was wood everywhere, and I burst in, and [smiling triumphantly] I had a crap.

Stephen Fry: Mithras was a savior sent to Earth to live as a mortal, through whom it was possible for sinners to be reborn into immortal life; he died for our sins but came back to life the following Sunday; he was born of a virgin on December 25th in a manger or, perhaps, a cave, attended by shepherds, and became known as The Light of the World; he had twelve disciples with whom he shared a last meal before dying; his devotees symbolically consumed the flesh and blood of him. Because Mithras was a sun god he was worshiped on Sundays...

Alan Davies: I took my nephews to London Zoo, because a friend of ours is a zookeeper there, and she can get you in sort of the back. And we went in to see a lion, and they said, "There's some mesh — there's small mesh and big mesh. You must stay on the side where the big mesh is. Don't go near the small mesh. Stay where the big mesh is. Do you understand?" And the kids went—[nods nervously] And we just went in, and my nephew turned to me and said, "What's mesh?"

Bill Bailey: I was in Brazil, and I went into an enclosure with a Jaguar. And this Brazilian handler said "It's very important: always approach from the front". And I went, right, okay, and I was just getting closer to the front of it. And then he said "Oh no, sorry, never. Sorry! My English..."

Stephen Fry: So that's all from Bill, Jo, Jeremy, Alan and Pudsey and me and I'll leave you with this thought about one form of entertainment we haven't covered tonight, from Noel Coward: "People are wrong when they say that opera is not what it used to be. It is exactly what it used to be, that is what is wrong with it." Good night.

[On Bertrand Russell's proof that 1 + 1 = 2]
Stephen Fry: In order to prove mathematics from the very beginning, you have to establish the first principle of arithmetic, and that piece of symbolic logic was proving that one plus one equals two.
David Mitchell: It’s a bit late, the 20th century, to prove that, I’d say.
Stephen Fry: A bit late?
David Mitchell: You’ve got quite a lot riding by the 20th century on one plus one being two, you know? There’s quite a lot of engineering happening. Quite a complex international economy. If you find out that it doesn’t equal two, what do we do? Just burn everything! God know anything could fall on our heads. Money, you might as well eat it. Forget civilisation!

[After confirming that the reason Tour de France cyclists shave their legs has nothing to do with aerodynamics or speed]
Hugh Dennis: It's a shame it doesn't make any difference, because I've been using the fact that I don't shave my legs as an excuse for going five hours slower than the guy who won.
Stephen Fry: Which stage did you do?
Hugh Dennis: There's an open stage every year. An amateur stage. You do it two weeks before they do it. Eight thousand of us, and by the end, there were four thousand of us left at the end of it. I started in 2400th place, and I finished in 3400th place.
Stephen Fry: Oh no.
Alan Davies: You mean a thousand people overtook you?
Hugh Dennis: I was passed by a thousand people. And it took me... it took eleven hours to do this stage. The winner of the actual proper stage when they did it the next week was a guy called Vinokourov, I think his name was. He did it in five hours, but he was using someone else’s blood. And he was thrown out of the stage that night for blood doping.
Phill Jupitus: [Laughing.] Someone else’s blood!
Hugh Dennis: But it took me nine hours to catch up to the bloke with the one leg.

Stephen Fry: So—exactly. The one place in Paris he couldn't see the Eiffel Tower was inside the Eiffel Tower.
Marcus Brigstocke: Could he not maybe just ask for a chair facing the other way?

Reginald D. Hunter: I was at a party here, and this guy was telling me about when he wore corduroy, and he says, "You're an American, do you know what corduroy is?"

And eventually this girl who we didn't notice left the room, and she went upstairs to her apartment, and she just dashed in the room with a corduroy jacket, "Here! This is what it is! This is what it is!" And you know, I just … I went along with it because there's nothing like the warm look on white people's faces when they feel like they're teaching you something.

Emma Thompson: This fantastic effect I used to have on him, 'cause I could make—I could do it now—I'm not going to, but I could—I could make him scream.
Stephen Fry: [small scream] No. No. Don't.
Emma Thompson: Not like that scream that we just heard, but a real, actual sort of scream of terror and fright, just by appearing nude at the top of his stairs. [Stephen shudders.] And doing what I like to do, which is locking all the doors at the bottom, so that when he tried to get out … [Stephen mimes pounding on locked doors] … as I came down the stairs, going, "Yes, baby, they're all yours!" By the end of which he was in a state of such extreme panic, and it's great to make someone very clever fall apart like that.

How dare they call us luvvies!" You know? I mean, that's a bit overdone. On the other hand, it's a bit tedious when the Daily Mail says "luvvie couple XYZ" or something …
Emma Thompson: Do you know what the first citation of it is in the OED?
Stephen Fry: No.
Emma Thompson: It's you.
Stephen Fry: What?! No! I can't believe... Did I invent the word?

Jimmy Carr: The feeding of the five thousand? Like there's five thousand people and they wanted some bread and fish. I reckon that was just about four and a half thousand people going, "What have we got, bread and fish? I'm all right, thanks. I'll have something when I get home."
David: The other interesting thing about that story is that out of the five thousand people, only two of them had thought to bring any food. And so in a way it's, okay, good miracle, but the other side of it is 4,998 idiots with no sense of foresight at all. And Jesus doesn't make them learn a lesson from that!
Stephen Fry: "This is the sermon on the Mount. This isn't Glastonbury," he could have said, couldn't he?
David Mitchell: But, you know, he should have said "You didn't bring any food! Of course there's not gonna be any food! Think about it!" ... "Plan next time! Judea would be better if people planned!" But no. "Yeah, it always works out fine; Jesus'll magic up some grub!" No! He's gonna get crucified one day, and then what are you gonna eat?

Alan Davies: No point in just talking to it. Give it honey!
David Mitchell: They're very much a one-recipe species, aren't they?
Dara Ó Briain: I'm intrigued, because I would, um, I generally give it a sole of my shoe. You know, not to be harsh, but…
Alan Davies: [exasperated] You step on a struggling, crawling bee? Trying to get back to the hive?
Dara Ó Briain: What? As opposed to rehabilitate it?
Alan Davies: I like honey! I have it on my porridge! You murderer!
David Mitchell: [after the argument has gone on for a while] But isn't it true, though, that a bee, in its entire lifetime, makes absolutely tiny amount of honey overall? So you don't have to give much rehabilitating honey to this one bee before the nation, the world, is making a net loss! I mean, it's useless. If you only get one teaspoon of honey from a whole bee's lifetime, and every time you have to get it back on its feet it takes a teaspoon and a half, suddenly there's no honey at all! You're insulting it apart from anything else! It's like showing a very tired mason a whole cathedral!

Sandi Toksvig: [dead serious] Is it toilet paper? [general laughter] No, seriously. Is it - [more laughter]

[On a painting of Leonardo da Vinci's deathbed, Alan has spotted a figure looking very much like Rodney Bewes]

Just imagine, on the news, them going: "And today it emerged that actor Rodney Bewes has been alive for as long as time."
Graham Norton: Given the things that we're talking about, or pretending to know what we're talking about, I actually really don't know who Rodney Bewes is.
[After Stephen has explained who Rodney Bewes is]
Stephen Fry: I have to say, the whole point about QI, right, is that the rest of the world talks about cultural things, reality TV and pop stars and Rodney Bewes… and we talk about Leonardo. And what you've done [motions towards Graham] by coming on is we started - no, you actually. [turns to point at Alan] We started talking about Leonardo and we've arrived at Rodney Bewes!

David Mitchell: [Banging both fists on the table] It's so cruel!
Stephen Fry: He's wise enough to spot a double bluff!
David Mitchell: It's just the technique of the bully! You hit us! And then you go: [with appropriate mimicry] "Oh, you thought I was going to hit you! I wouldn't hit you. I'm not going to hit you. This is my hand to stroke you." And we go: "Aargh, aargh, he's stroking us!"

[Panelists can win extra points by buzzing at a sexist comment]
Sandi Toksvig: I, I like pink. 'Pink makes the boys wink'. And I think that's right. I've known boys who've been complete winkers. Marvelous thing, pink.
Jack Dee: I, uh, sorry. [rings in] Bit sexist, wasn't that.
Sandi Toksvig: [leans forward] Now, Jack, I've only just started. This is the beginning, my dear.
Jack Dee: I'm gonna come down you like a…

Alan Davies: Friend of ours had a baby in Thailand. English couple. And the Thai woman said to her: "If you look lovely when you pregnant, you will have girl. If you look tired and ugly, dress badly, you will have boy." And she said: "What do you think I'm gonna have?" "Boy."

Phill Jupitus: Oh yeah, the tactical chunder. Totally.
Alan Davies: Yeah. "I feel terrible. I'm gonna have to go and have a tactical chunder." Come back five minutes later: "I'm fine now!"

Alan Davies: [defiantly] Oh?
Stephen Fry: It's very valuable.
Alan Davies: I was gonna make it go over the desk! [gives in and crawls back to his chair] I can't believe I'm not allowed to play with it.
Stephen Fry: I'm afraid I was given specific 'Alan not to touch' instructions.

[On whether the moon landings were a hoax]
Alan Davies: I did an advert with Patrick Moore, and I said: "So, Patrick, did they land on the moon?" And he looked so annoyed with me. He actually explained to me how he'd help to map the moon for NASA and how he'd spent years in the project, and the landing site was partly his idea… And if I ever spoke to him again, he was gonna be sick in my eyes.

Stephen Fry: The ecological footprint is a measure of the amount of land needed to regenerate consumed resources and deal with the resultant waste, and current figures calculated by the United Nations are that we are using up 1.4 times more than the planet can restore.
Alan Davies: The thing is… we evolved from this planet, we are of this planet, we live on this planet, so… can't we do what we like?
Stephen Fry: Yep… absolutely.
Alan Davies: I mean we are victims of our own evolution; I just happened to have come in at this point and now I have to turn the lights out and can't see where I'm going when I go to bed.

[On the I series "Nobody knows" bonus]
Bill Bailey: What are the points that you gain by using it correctly?
Stephen Fry: I think we all agree that nobody in this universe understands QI's scoring system.
Bill Bailey: Right. So, by that logic, were we to raise the subject of the scoring system, and I was to do that, [holds up his "Nobody knows" card] then… [he's cut off by laughter and applause]
Alan Davies: He's made a very good point.
Stephen Fry: Somehow, I feel like I'm trapped in an infinite loop. Yes, fortunately that isn't one of the questions.
David Mitchell: If it were in a hypothetical round a question - "What is the QI scoring system?" - and then "Nobody knows", [mimics lifting up the card] what would happen to the person who does the QI scoring? Would they not then feel rather sad? They are at least presumably sitting there thinking that they know.

Stephen Fry: No. Well -
[The klaxon goes off, with "after the Second World War" flashing on the screens]
David Mitchell: [waving finger] Okay! No, no, no! "After 1939" and "after the Second World War" are not synonymous. Now, this is just giving you time to type "after 1939".

Sean Lock: Easier?

Frank Skinner: I tell you what's always frustrated me, and that is that on a standard typewriter keyboard, when you hit the semicolon, you just have to hit the key.

Clive Anderson: Bit of a smartarse, were you?

Henning Wehn: Yeah. You were nothing but a drain on British resources!
