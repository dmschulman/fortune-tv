Butt-head: Uh, no. He wasn't like, very friendly.
Beavis: Yeah, heh, he doesn't like me.
Doctor: Well, we'll have to find him anyway. In a suspected case of rabies, the animal has to be destroyed, of course. And to check for presence of the disease, he cut off the head and disect the brain.
Butt-head: Woah. That's cool.
Doctor: Actually, yes. It is kind of cool.
Beavis: Yeah, yeah, yeah! Come on, Butt-head, let's go find that dog.

Doctor: Hmm, so far nothing checks out. Maybe you were lucky.
Butt-head: Uh, you mean like, no decrapitation?
Beavis: I've got it, I've got rabies!

Mr. Van Driessen: It's ironic that we in this country who cherish freedom occasionally support governments who are less responsive to human rights.

Beavis: What's a speech im-pediment?
Butt-head: Speech im-pediments suck!

Ms. Jenkins: Butt-head, this might be a good time to work on your "s".
Butt-head: Eeeh, I didn't know my ass needed any work.
Ms. Jenkins: Now don't get defensive Butt-head, I just want to try to clean it up a little, OK? Now try this. Make a "t" sound, then throw it out like this. Everyone, let's try to help Butt-head, OK?
Butt-head: Hey Beavis, check it out!
Ms. Jenkins: Settle down please, all right boys? OK. What I'd like everyone to do is to repeat these sentences while watching your mouth in your mirrors, OK? All right, here goes: Speaking slowly as such can say just as much.

Beavis: Yeah, this chick rules. "Ass munch"!
Ms. Jenkins: Very good, boys! As much.
Beavis: Ass munch!

Beavis: Wait a minute, you know, that's not true, Butt-head, we can see a lot of butts.
Butt-head: Uhh, oh yeah.
Kurt Loder: Hey, hey, don't just stand there, guys, interview somebody, will you?
Butt-head: Uhh, we could interview their butts. [laughs]
Beavis: Yeah! It'd be like, "Hello butt, what do you think of the parade so far?" and they'd be like [imitates fart noises] "Well, BBBBBRRRRRFFFFFTTTTTT!!!!"
Butt-head: Uhh, shut up, Beavis. That isn't even funny. Uhh, besides, I wanna see, like, naked butts.
Beavis: Yeah yeah, really. You know Loder, the butts were a lot better at that porno place, and it was a lot warmer too.
Butt-head: Yeah, really. Hey Loder, here's a news report for you. I'm freezing my nutsack off.
%
Butt-head: Uhh, hey, we're back.
Beavis: Hey Butt-head, check it out, there's a marching band out here.
Butt-head: Really? They suck.
Beavis: Yeah, but, you know, it could be kinda cool to be in a marching band. You know, those guys just poop right on the street.
Butt-head: What are you talking about, Beavis?
Beavis: No, no, I'm serious. I'm serious, one time, when I was a kid I saw this parade, and after the marching band went by, there were these big huge turds everywhere. And it was like, there was grass sticking out of them and stuff. It was cool.
Butt-head: Beavis, you dumbass, those turds didn't come from the band, they came from the horses.
Beavis: But, um...oh! That would explain the grass. But, um, that's really too bad, you know, cause I was thinking it would be cool to join the school band, and you know, you'd just be marching along, playing your instrument, you know, and be like, [sings] "Dun-da-da-dun-da-da-da-da-da-plop!"
Butt-head: Beavis...
Beavis: Yeah, and then, whenever I'd be taking a poop at school, somebody would be like "What are you doing in there?", and I'd be like, "I'm trying out for the band!", plop.
Butt-head: Dammit Beavis, if this wasn't Thanksgiving, I'd be slapping the crap out of you, now shut up. [to camera] Hey Loder, this music sucks, why don't you make yourself useful and play a video?
%
Beavis: Um, heh, is this football?
Butt-head: Uhhh, no I think this is that, uh, shampoo commercial.
Beavis: No it's not! Y'know what this is? This is Telemundo! [gibbers in Spanish]
Butt-head: How come you always watch Telemundo, Beavis?
Beavis: Um, because they have all these fine chicks, with big boobs, and like, really tight dresses.
Butt-head: Oh yeah. It seems like they always have some big, fat host on Telemundo, who's like, all dorky looking. And then like, all the chicks are really good looking.
Beavis: Yeah, yeah, that guy's cool!
Butt-head: Yeah, he always walks up to the chicks with his microphone and goes: "Aprenda, [Spanish gibberish]."
Beavis: Oh yeah. I bet he scores constantly!
%
Beavis: Y'know what I think I'm gonna do? I'm gonna shave my chest like these dudes, and walk around with one of these vests, and like learn to dance like that. And then, I will score all the time!
Butt-head: Instead of doing that, why don't you just, like, talk all that Spanish stuff? That would probably work.
Beavis: Heh, oh yeah. "Hey baby, [Spanish gibberish]."
Butt-head: I'm gonna try becoming one of those big, fat dudes, and go: "[Spanish gibberish]".
%
Beavis: This music kind of sucks.
Butt-head: This isn't even music really. This is just like that kind of crap that guy plays down at the organ store at the mall, on one of those $10,000 organs.

Butt-head: "Uh, that'll be $10,000 son. Please don't touch it."

Beavis: You know, they compliment each other, you know?
Butt-head: Let's see, what else can they do to be an asswipe?
Beavis: See, maybe they'll steal some jump ropes from little girls. Steal some money from a homeless guy.
Butt-head: Uh, boy. It's like, if their music by itself didn't make you hate them, they're giving you plenty of other reasons.
Beavis: I bet deaf people hate them too.
%
Butt-head: I'm glad these guys found each other.
Beavis: I wonder how they met.
Butt-head: They were probably like, pushing over some kid's sand castle, and they were like "Whoa! You have tight jeans and Converse All-Stars just like me! Do you like shoving little kids? I do too! Let's start a band."

Johnny Cash: First time I shot her...
Butt-head: Whoa! He shouldn't have shot that chick. She's pretty hot.
Beavis: Yeah, really!
Butt-head: I would've taken her off his hands.
Beavis: Yeah, you know what he should have done? He should have fired some warning shots in the air, and that would have scared her away. And then I could score.
Butt-head: I guess if a chick has to choose between dying or like doing it with you, you might actually have a chance of scoring, Beavis.
Beavis: Yeah, I know! That's why I was suggesting it.
%
Beavis: Hey Butt-head, did you see it when Bonaduce fought Donny Osmond?
Butt-head: Uh... that was on Pay-per-view, Beavis. We don't get that.

Butt-head: Oh yeah! Was that when he like, threw a chair at him and broke his nose?
Beavis: Yeah, yeah yeah!
Butt-head: That would be cool like, if Mrs. Partridge kicked Geraldo's ass.
Beavis: Yeah, yeah! And the winner gets to face Bonaduce in the finals.
Butt-head: That would be cool if like, the whole Partridge family kicked Geraldo's ass.
Beavis: Oh yeah! And then like, Tracy could kick him in the nads.
Butt-head: Yeah. She could stick her tambourine up his butt.
Beavis: Or like, Chris could stick a drumstick up his butt.

Butt-head: Uhh, yeah. I mean, it's like, the music is horrible. But it rules!
Beavis: We should watch this all the time. Yeah, this rules.

Beavis: Yeah, yeah! Like, all you'd have to do is say "Yeah, I have nothing to do with these guys. Wanna make out?" That would rule.

Beavis: Whoa, check it out, Butt-head! How did that dude get all those chicks?
Butt-head: 'Cause, dumbass, his name is Schlong.
Beavis: Oh yeah! Cheech & Schlong. I forgot about that. You know what? Cheech should change his name to Buttcheeks, and then it's like, Buttcheeks & Schlong.
Butt-head: Uh...I don't think you'd get chicks with a name like Buttcheeks, Beavis.
Beavis: Um...oh. That was my nickname when I was a kid--Buttcheeks.
Butt-head: Uh...oh yeah.
%
Beavis: Check it out, Butt-head, a whore!

Butt-head: Uh...well, if you're gonna do that, why not just pretend, you know, you're doing it with her?
Beavis: Oh, well I was gonna do that. See, I was gonna pretend she was a whore, and then I was gonna pretend I had some money, and then I was gonna pretend I was doing her, see? That's how it works, see? That's what you call a fantasy, bungwipe.

Butt-head: You know what this chick's name is?
Beavis: What?
Butt-head: Her name is Chick.
Beavis: No it's not.
Butt-head: No, I'm serious. I've seen this before. Her name's Chick. That's pretty cool, 'cause you can remember her name, 'cause she's a chick, and her name is Chick.
Beavis: Oh yeah. Maybe I should change my name to "Dude".
Butt-head: Yeah, or maybe you could change it to "Dumbass".
%
Beavis: She's supposed to be like in high school or something?
Butt-head: Uh...I don't know, she looks pretty old.
Beavis: Yeah, I think you're not allowed to become a whore until you get older.

Beavis: Well if you would shut up, maybe I would concentrate! Bunghole.

Beavis: OK, let's see you write a song. Come on!
Butt-head: Uh... OK. Uh, let's see. Uh...I wanna hit you.

Beavis: Yeah, exactly.
%
Butt-head: Uh...doesn't your mom watch Montel Williams?
Beavis: Yeah, she watches Montel Williams, The Jerry Springer Show, Jane Whitney...she watches all of them. She's always like, "I should be on one of those shows, Beavis!" [makes drunken sound]
Butt-head: Yeah, but like, what would be the topic?

Butt-head: Uh...
Beavis: Was it Stewart?
Butt-head: No, Stewart's still alive. We saw him yesterday.

Butt-head: Uh... she didn't kill herself, she just moved away.
Beavis: Whoa, really? Wow. You know, that's kinda surprising. I thought she killed herself.
%
Butt-head: Remember when they set that grief counselor to talk to us right after, uh... whatever his name was died?

Butt-head: Yeah, he like turned his chair backwards and rolled up his sleeves.
Beavis: You know, he invited me over to his apartment for spaghetti too.
Butt-head: Uh, that's kinda weird. You didn't go, did you?
Beavis: Um, I don't really remember. Last thing I remember, I got into his van, and um, he gave me some lemonade, and then the next thing I remember, I woke up under a bridge.
Butt-head: Uh... are you just making this up? You never told me about this.
Beavis: See, that's exactly what Rick said would happen if I ever told anybody. He would say I made it up, see?
Butt-head: Uh...
Beavis: He's a smart guy, that Rick.
Butt-head: Uh... okay, Beavis.
Beavis: You know, I think he can see into the future too because he also told me that my butt might hurt for a couple of days. And it did. You see that? Amazing.
%
Beavis: Well I'll be damned, it's Dave Navarro.

%
Butt-head: How come the Chili Peppers have new guitar player, like, every couple weeks?
Beavis: Well, I think what happens, is, um, like they join the band, and then Flea is just like kickin' ass, and like dancing and Anthony is getting all the chicks, and then like the guitar player is like, "Screw this".
Butt-head: Did you hear that on MTV News? [imitating MTV News theme music] Do-do-do-do-do!
%
Butt-head: Check it out, he's got a face painted on his stomach.
Beavis: If I was in them, I'd paint a butt on my stomach. And then my bellybutton would be the butthole.
Butt-head: Yeah, but you could just, like, you know, show your real butt, and it would be faster and, like, more realistic. Dumbass.
Beavis: No, no. I don't think you understand what I'm saying. I'd paint the butt on my stomach, see...
Butt-head: Beavis, you're going to have about four buttholes if you don't shut up.
Beavis: It's not my fault if you don't understand, Butt-head! Dumbass!
%
Beavis: Oh no. This video freaks me out. It's like, you know, I get all excited when I see the chicks, but then I see these stubby dudes, and it, like...makes my testes retract into my globules.
Butt-head: Yeah. It gives me a special feeling in my seminefrious tubules.
Beavis: I wanna do every single girl in this video.
Butt-head: Uhh, you wanna do, like, every girl in every video, Beavis.
Beavis: No. Not really.
Butt-head: Uhh, name one girl in a video that you wouldn't wanna do.
Beavis: Let me think...oh, I know. Um, there's that one video, you know, where they're like, "Been Caught Stealing", and um...there's that one girl and she's, like, you know, stuffing fruit and stuff down her shirt. I don't wanna do her.
Butt-head: Uhh...that's a dude dressed up like a girl, Beavis. That doesn't count.
Beavis: Oh. Uh, let me think..."Wilson Phillips"...uh, no, yes I'd do her...ah, oh, um...no. Boy, maybe you're right. I just wanna make love to all the women of the world.
Butt-head: Me too.

Beavis: Really?
Butt-head: Yeah. You're always like, [imitates Beavis] "Yeah, uhuhuhuhuhuhuh."
Beavis: I don't sound like that! [coughs] I'm just gonna be quiet for a while because my throat hurts.
Butt-head: Okay. Good.
%
Butt-head: You sound really stupid most of the time. You're like [imitates Beavis] "Yeah, yeah, it's pretty cool because...[incoherent gibberish]"
Beavis: Shut up, Butt-head, I don't talk like that! I'm not gonna say anything. I'm just gonna be quiet. Ow! [coughs] Ow!
%
Butt-head: What's that guy patting his stomach for?
Beavis: Maybe he's got like, a hurt rabbit in his shirt, he's like, going "As soon as we're done with this video, I'm gonna let you out, then I'll give you a carrot, we're gonna fix your leg..."
Butt-head: [interrupting] Dammit Beavis, now see, that's what I'm talking about, right there. You're going, [mockingly] "Yeah, maybe it's that rabbit in his stomach, [incoherent gibberish]..."
%
Butt-head: What the hell is this dude saying? He's like, saying "Fried egg, fried egg, fried egg,"
Beavis: Fried...[coughs]...fried egg, fried, [coughs] fried egg...

Beavis: [singing along] Now whip it!/Into shape!/Shape it up!/Get it straight!/Go forward!/Move ahead!/Try to detect it!/It's not too late!/[starts going out of time with the song]To whip it!/Into shape!/Shape it, uh...[realizes he is singing out of time]...go forward...move ahead, try to detect it...
Butt-head: That sucked, Beavis.
Beavis: Well, at least I tried. You just sit there on your ass and make me do all the work.
%
Butt-head: Check out those hats.
Beavis: Those are cool. You can stack one inside the other and you can have like all different colors, you know? It's like you can wear one one day and another the other day and like put 'em on your head y'know? And they can like protect you from like harmful rays.
Butt-head: Beavis, you're a damn weirdo.
Beavis: Shut up, Butt-head. I'm not from here, you know.
%
Beavis: Whoa, check out that tornado!
Butt-head: That's not a tornado, that's that Tasmanian Devil dude.
Beavis: Oh yeah, he kicks ass. Did you ever see that time he beat Bugs Bunny upside the head with a shovel?
Butt-head: Yeah. I like the one where they grab Elmer Fudd by the head, and form through a knothole in a fence, and then beat him in the head over and over again with a shovel.
Beavis: Oh yeah. That's kinda harsh, Butt-head.
Butt-head: Yeah. Cartoons are cool.

Beavis: Yeah, then maybe I could watch it.
Butt-head: You watch golf all the time, Beavis.
Beavis: Oh yeah. Golf is cool.
%
Butt-head: Check this out. [quiet voice] It looks like he's gonna use his nine-iron to smash the big fat dead guy's face in.
Beavis: [quiet voice] That's right, Butt-head. I think what he's planning on doing, is smashing his glasses in, and shoving the nine-iron up his bunghole.
Butt-head: It looks straight...oh, he's in the water! That'll cost him a stroke.
Beavis: That's right, Butt-head. Oh, I don't believe it! He's gonna actually try to, it looks like it's gonna go...
Butt-head: [raises voice to normal volume] You can't do it, Beavis. Shut up.

Butt-head: You're not good at anything.

Butt-head: Whoa! I've never seen a puppet with hooters like that.
Beavis: Those are some big boobs.
Butt-head: They probably have this chick on the show to teach kids the number 2.
Beavis: I'd say this puppet chick right here is one of the top three muppets that I would do.
Butt-head: Really? Who else would you do, Beavis?
Beavis: Well, Miss Piggy's kinda hot.
Butt-head: That fat pig?
Beavis: Shut up, Butt-head! I like 'em with a little meat on their bones.

Butt-head: I'd be like "Well, I got it from the airport." Cause they have a store there.
Beavis: Ah shut up, Butt-head. Keep that up and I'm gonna put the smackdown on yo' ass, beotch!
Butt-head: What did you say, Beavis?

%
Butt-head: Whoa. I didn't know that, like, rap dudes ski.
Beavis: Um, I don't think these are real rap dudes, Butt-head.
Butt-head: Yeah. They thought if they, like, went to a ski resort, that they'd be sure no real rap dudes would find them and beat the crap out of 'em.
Beavis: It's the only place they're safe! They probably, like, sit around the corner, and like, have their, like, big 40 ouncers of hot chocolate.
Butt-head: Yeah. No chicks, no butts.
Beavis: Get me some marshmallows, bee-otch! Change the channel, Butt-head, I've had enough of this.

Beavis: Oh, really? Well, at least that's something.
%
Butt-head: You know, they don't have to keep showing her face just because she's singing.

Butt-head: Yeah!
%
Butt-head: Look at this stupid stuff she keeps doing with her face.
Beavis: Yeah. This chick is pretty dumb.
Butt-head: Yeah, and she's probably a slut too.

Butt-Head: Uh, oh yeah. It's Spanish.
Beavis: Wow. So Jesus can speak Spanish? That's uh, that's pretty impressive you know, because it's not easy to learn a second language. Not anybody can do that.
Butt-Head: It is a miracle.
Beavis: Yeah, that Christ is something else. I didn't know he had it in him, you know?
Butt-Head: Yeah. He may look like a bum, but he can do a lot.
%
Beavis: [as prisoners try to escape prison] Wow, they really hate this song.

Beavis: Look, a buttcheek! A schlong! A nad!
Butt-head: Those are just hands, Beavis. That's not his nads, his nutsack or his buttcheeks.
Beavis: I don't know. You know, this is kind of messed up. It's like, they have all these dudes there, and like, they don't even think of them like people. They're just there, like they're these things for these chicks to look at and get off on, it's like, it's disgusting! This band should be ashamed of the way they're treating men, and um, and uh, these men shouldn't have the uh, they should not be in this video!
Butt-head: Uh, well...if these chicks asked you to get naked and be in their video, would you do it?
Beavis: Uh, yeah! But that's different; see, but then it would be me, and I'd be naked. That would rule.
%
Beavis: How come whenever you see a chick band, they're always looking down at their hands when they play?
Butt-head: Maybe they're looking at their boobs; did you ever think of that?
Beavis: Oh yeah. I guess I would look at my boobs too.
%
Butt-head: Check it out. That drummer dude is surrounded by a bunch of naked dudes.
%
Butt-head: These chicks are pretty cool. They just have a bunch of naked dudes around so they can use them whenever they need it.
Beavis: Yeah. Some bands have a bunch of water bottles and stuff around so if they get thirsty, but these chicks just like, keep naked dudes. That rules--you know, for a chick.
Butt-head: It's a pretty good idea. You'll probably see a lot more bands doing that now.

%
Butt-head: You know, he's bisexual.
Beavis: Oh yeah. Um, I know what that means, but just as a test, why don't you tell me what that means?
Butt-head: Beavis, you dumbass, you don't know? It means he has two schlongs!
Beavis: So, like, um...if you had two wieners, how many nads would you have?
Butt-head: Uh...I'd guess you'd have, you know, like three or something.
Beavis: And then, whoa, I just thought of something else! So like, if you have two wieners, you know, if you go to take a leak, you just decide which one you're gonna take a leak out of...or you take a leak out of both of them...you know, sometimes you have a boner! Would you have both of them at the same time?
Butt-head: You should do stand-up comedy, Beavis.
Beavis: Oh really? Thanks, I think so too.
%
Beavis: Well, I guess I'll go take a leak.
Butt-head: No way, Beavis! I get to take a leak when the video sucks.

Beavis: No way, Butt-head! I was gonna take a dump too, I was just like, you know, embarrassed.
Butt-head: Well, you snooze, you lose. [leaves the room]

%
Beavis: You know, another cool ride to jump off of is the Haunted House. I used to like, go in there, and jump off the car. Then I'd go over by the witches and wait 'til the next car comes, and then I'd put a broom up my butt and go "Poopapoo!".
Butt-head: Beavis, witches don't put brooms up their butt, they put 'em between their legs.

Butt-head: Uhh, yeah. But, like, if they could really do that, then you could just have them just make your wiener bigger.
Beavis: No no, Butt-head. I'm saying they make me bigger, see then because my wiener would get bigger, then shrink me, and keep my wiener the same size.

Butt-head: I'm pretty funny.
%
Beavis: You know, if I was a big bird, I'd fly around in the sky and stuff, and then, like, fly over people and poop on their lunch. I'd be like [imitates dive-bomber] "Nyaaaaaaaaanyaaaaa-poop!-nyaaaaaaaanyaaaaa-poop!"
Butt-head: That would be cool.
Beavis: Yeah, that would rule. Actually, y'know I probably could do that without being a bird. It's like, I could go into the cafeteria, and just like stand up on the table, y'know, and pull down my pants and like, go around while people are eating their lunch and just go "Poop!"
Butt-head: Okay, settle down, Beavis.
Beavis: And run over there and go "Poop!" A little "Poop!" over there.
Butt-head: That's enough.

Beavis: That would be cool. But then it's like, you'd still have to like, watch for hours and hours and hours until it came on.
Butt-head: No you wouldn't, Beavis! It's like, if they say it's gonna be on like, at eleven o'clock or something, then like, you know when it's gonna be on.
Beavis: Yeah, but like, if it's like, six o'clock, then it's like, you have to keep watching it, because it's not on.
Butt-head: Uhh...oh yeah. Well, at least you what time it's on, though.

Butt-head: This must be what happens when you lose your penis!
Beavis: Yeah! I always try to keep my johnson in my pants so I won't lose it!
Butt-head: You're pretty stupid, Beavis!

Beavis: Holy crap!
Butt-head: Whoa! What the hell is this crap?
Beavis: Oh my God!
Butt-head: Is this, like, a joke?

Butt-head: I thought people usually look cool in leather jackets?
Beavis: Yeah! What's wrong? How come these people all look like wussies?
Butt-head: Sometimes, it just doesn't work, Beavis.
Beavis: Maybe these are, like, vinyl jackets.
Butt-head: No, they're leather. You can't polish a turd, Beavis.
Beavis: Yeah! I tried that once, I got, like, some dog doo-doo, and like, some, uh, black shoe polish, and then I, like, tried to polish it, but it's like, it's like, you can't polish a turd!
Butt-head: That's disgusting, Beavis! I bet it was pretty cool to try, though.

Voiceover: Kill everything, kill everything...
Beavis: Yeah, okay! Kill everything. KILL EVERYTHING! Except me.
Butt-head: Dammit, Beavis. Don't you care about anybody but yourself?
Beavis: Um...uh...no. I don't care about anybody or anything, except me.
Butt-head: What about when I'm kicking your ass? Do you care about me then?
Beavis: Um...no, I just care about my ass. [In Cornholio accent] It is each man for himself! I will fight and die for myself!
Butt-head: Well, I guess that's a good thing because like, nobody likes you. And like, you can like, care about yourself, while I'm off scoring with chicks.

Butt-head: Uh...oh yeah. That's like that joke, what does the perfect woman look like?
Beavis: Um, yeah, what?
Butt-head: Uh...I don't know, she's probably, you know, pretty hot. I think it's like, she has big thingys or something?
Beavis: Oh yeah, that's pretty funny. She has big thingys. It's pretty funny.
%
Beavis: Cool, a cartoon.
Butt-head: Those aren't cartoons, dumbass. That's just clay.
Beavis: So? Clay can be cartoons.
Butt-head: No it can't. Cartoons are, like, drawings, or something. Clay is, like, a thing.
Beavis: So? Drawings are things.
Butt-head: Dammit Beavis, you're never gonna out...be...be smarter than me. So don't even try. Just shut up.
%
Beavis: I think I know what this is. I think this is, um, Davey and Goliath.
Butt-head: Oh yeah. That's that show that's on Sunday mornings when there's nothing on but church.
Beavis: You know one thing about that show, you know that Goliath is, um, he's supposed to be a dog, but I've never seen him lick his nads. Have you ever noticed that?
Butt-head: I saw him do it once real fast. He was probably like [imitating Goliath] "Uhh, Davey, you should try this."
Beavis: Yeah, and then Davey said "Maybe I should pet you first." And you know, also, you know, I've never seen him poop either.
Butt-head: I thought I saw him poop once, but I think it was just, like, a piece of clay that fell off his butt.
%
Beavis: Whoa! This looks like it might rock.
Butt-head: Yeah, maybe.
Beavis: Yeah. I mean, I dunno, maybe it's alright. I guess it sounds kinda cool.
%
Butt-head: You know what might make it different is like, you know, if you were really dizzy when you were watching this.
Beavis: Yeah, yeah, if you were all like dizzy in the head and you were watching this!
Butt-head: Yeah. Want me to strike you?
Beavis: No, I know how to make myself dizzy, check it out. I learned this one time, check this out. [Beavis puts his thumb in his mouth and blows very hard, eventually hyperventilating. He then goes into a trance.] I think there's a problem with this video, as it is highly derivative of many popular bands within the genre, although when viewed on its own merit, it does have a decent groove.
Butt-head: Uh, Beavis?
Beavis: However, what it has in groove, it lacks in originality.
Butt-head: What's your problem?
Beavis: One can't help but be reminded of such bands as Pearl Jam, White Zombie, Suicidal Tendencies, and other bands that bear the mantle of so-called alternative rock.
Butt-head: You're talking like a dork, Beavis!
Beavis: One is even reminded of Laurie Anderson when she wore curlers. This video speaks less to the heart, and more to the sphincter.
Butt-head: Beavis!
Beavis: In closing, I think Korn would do well to learn more from...[Butt-head hits him several times]...AAAAAHHH!!! OW!!! Whoa, what happened?
Butt-head: You got all dizzy and then you started talking like a dumbass.
Beavis: Whoa, really? Wow.
Butt-head: But then you did say spinxter.

Beavis: Hey Butt-head, check it out. That chick on the drums, that's that chick that's at games holding up that sign.
Butt-head: Oh yeah. It's like it says John on it, then it has his phone number.

Butt-head: Yeah, and then hang up on him. That would be cool.
Beavis: Yeah, yeah. That'd teach him a lesson.

Beavis: Ooh, baby.
Butt-head: Ooh. [Beavis and Butt-head dance] Lenny rules.

Butt-head: Whoa, check out that chick!
Beavis: Yeah! She like, came out of the trunk!
Butt-head: She must be like, the spare.

Butt-head: Uh, you don't have a trunk, buttmunch. You ride a bike.

Butt-head: Boy, this is horrible.
Beavis: Um...don't say that, Butt-head. I kinda feel sorry for these guys.
Butt-head: Yeah.
%
Beavis: Whoa! If I had a mic like that, I'd stick a mic into every end, so I'd be four times as loud.
Butt-head: Uh...no you wouldn't. You can only sing into one end at a time, Beavis.
Beavis: Not if I spun it around really fast, Butt-head.
Butt-head: No you wouldn't, Beavis. You'd still be singing into one end at a time.
Beavis: No, Butt-head. I'd spin it around and go REALLY fast. I'd be like [high-pitched groaning].

Butt-head: Uh... remember when you were little and your mom tried to lose you at IKEA?
Beavis: Oh, yeah, yeah! She's like, um... "just lay down and take a nap right here, Beavis. Everything's gonna be fine."

Butt-Head: Uhhh... [monsters and zombie-looking people around] Yup, that's Florida. Florida sucks.

Butt-head: Yeah. I wonder how come they don't have a douche for guys.
Beavis: Yeah. That would rule. Sometimes you know, I feel like, not so fresh...you know.

The Murmurs: And for that, you suck...

Beavis: Uh oh. I think it's one of those TV preachers.
Butt-head: Dammit Beavis, you'd better not send him all our money again.
Beavis: Sometimes I can't help myself. It's like, I start going "I know that's right. Hallelujah." And then I'm on the phone, and I'm like, "Yeah, yeah, here's all my money!"
Butt-head: Yeah, but it's like, you send him all your money and you're still just a dumbass with a lot of problems.

Butt-head: Ew! That was disgusting!
Beavis: Yeah really. That shouldn't show that kind of stuff on TV! Kids might be watching.

Beavis: Hey, it's that dude from Damn Yankees!
Butt-head: Oh yeah. Once I saw on MTV News that this dude likes to take, like, a bow and arrow and go like, shoot animals with it.
Beavis: No way, really? Doesn't he get in trouble?
Butt-head: No, I think it's okay. I think he can do that because he's like one of those, uh...Republicans.
Beavis: Really? I wanna become a Republican! That would rule!
Butt-head: But then like, I think once you become a Republican, it's like, you don't score anymore.
Beavis: Oh well. I guess I'll just keep being a Mexican, then.

Butt-head: You like this.
Beavis: Shut up, Butt-head! No I don't!
Butt-head: Beavis, I just saw you tapping your foot.

%
Butt-head: Whoa! This is kinda freaky.
Beavis: Yeah, see what I mean?
Butt-head: This is one of those art school chicks that like, you could score with them if you told them all their ideas were really good.
Beavis: Yeah! Yeah, that's probably how she made this video! Just like, got some rich guy, and told him all her ideas were really good, and he's like, "ooh, yeah."
Butt-head: Yeah. She's like, "uh... I want a unicorn, but then I'm gonna tear the horn off and put it on my head."
Beavis: Ooh, very good! Yeah.
Butt-head: Have another drink and continue.
Beavis: And then, I also want my brother to tap dance. He's really good.
Butt-head: The rich guy's probably like, "uh... these are all great ideas, but uh... I think it would be really like, uh, really empowering if you took off your clothes and jumped off a cliff." And he's like "if you want, I can help you become a citizen."
Beavis: Yeah, I don't think I can help your brother though.
%
Butt-head: This is why hot girls shouldn't keep a dream journal.

Beavis: Whoa, really? That'd be cool if you could, like, take like a bus tour through the hills and see all the bands.
Butt-head: Yeah, that would kick ass! It'd be like: "Up on your left is Soundgarden".
Beavis: Yeah, yeah: "And if you be real quiet, we might see Alice in Chains!"

Beavis: I know, but I've seen it in videos and stuff, and like, there's always lots of smoke and snakes, and like, cool stuff.
Butt-head: Beavis, church isn't like that. I went to church once, and it's like, there was a bunch of buttmunches strumming guitars going: "Here we are, all together as we sing our song joyfully!"
Beavis: Yeah? Well, that song's pretty cool.
Butt-head: No it's not, Beavis. It sucks! And then it's like, you have to go up and like, this guy puts a cracker in your mouth and like, sprays water on you and stuff.
Beavis: Really? Well that sounds cool too! Yeah.
Butt-head: Uh, yeah I guess it is kind of cool.
Beavis: Yeah, yeah, yeah, see, see? That's not that bad! "Here we are, alltogether as we sing our song..."

Beavis: Oh yeah. And then he sang, [mock-Chinese accent, sings] "Love me tender, love me true, never let me go..." [mock-Chinese gibberish] Taekwondo, better than Thai boxing!

%
Beavis: Hey Butt-head, does this Pantera guy ever relax?
Butt-head: Uhh, I don't think so. This guy's dad must have kicked his ass when he was a kid.
Beavis: Yeah, really. He was like, "Dammit Pantera, this beer is warm! Get me another one!"
Butt-head: Yeah. He was like, "You treat your stepmother with respect, Pantera! Or you'll be sleeping in the street!"
Beavis: He's like, "Dammit Pantera, I told you to get out there and mow that lawn! Oh, what's this? Is that a tear, Pantera? Oh, is daddy's little girl upset? I'm gonna kick your ass into next Tuesday, now get outta here! And quit acting like a damn little girl!"

Butt-head: Uhhh, I think it came out his nose.
Beavis: Um, is that supposed to be funny?
Butt-head: Uhh, it's supposed to be. It would have been funny if it came out of his butt!
Beavis: Why is that, I mean, how come it like, if it comes out of his nose, it's not that funny, but like, if it comes out of his butt, it's funny? Why is that?
Butt-head: Well, it's 'cause like, your butt has a crack in it.
Beavis: Oh yeah!
%
[one of the band members trips over a table]
Butt-head: What a wuss!
%
Beavis: I hate it when you go to the barber, and it's like, he starts cutting your hair and then he goes: "Soooo, how's school?"
Butt-head: Yeah. I usually say: "It sucks. Now shut up and cut my hair before I stick that comb up your butt!"
Beavis: You know, Butt-head, um, maybe that's why you get all those sucky hair cuts, y'know? Maybe you should try being a little nicer, yeah.
Butt-head: Beavis, I'm gonna shove a comb up your butt! My hair looks cool!
%
Butt-head: Oh no, it's another one of these. [Beavis groans] They need to try harder.
Beavis: Yeah, yeah, it's like, they're not even trying! Come on, come on! I want you to start over again, and this time, try! Come on, let's go, pick it up, come on, come on, here we go! Come on, one, two, three, four, yeah, come on! Come on, rock!

%
Butt-head: I think these guys are just lazy.
Beavis: Yeah, really. They're too lazy to rock, and they're too lazy to clean the tub.

Beavis: Heh, I do that sometimes. Poop!
Butt-head: You poop in the tub?
Beavis: Yeah. And then sometimes, I just pee all over the whole bathroom. Pee pee pee pee pee!
Butt-head: You're disgusting, Beavis!
Beavis: Heheh, yeah.
%
Beavis: You know, um, I have to say, um, I kind of like this song.
Butt-head: Uh... okay, Beavis.
Beavis: Yeah! Sometimes, um, if I'm not feeling to good about myself, I'll like, put this song on and like, put some fireworks in my pants, and I start to feel better.
Butt-head: Uh, do you light the fireworks?
Beavis: Well, yeah, I tried, but everytime I put the lighter down there, in my pants, it just goes out. I need longer fuses or something. Like a longer lighter.
Butt-head: You're a dumbass, Beavis.
%
Katy Perry: You don't have to feel like a waste of space...
Beavis: My guidance counselor said the same thing, you know, I don't have to feel like a waste of space, but when Katy Perry says it, she has fireworks coming out of her boobs, kind of uh, kind of gives me a special feeling, you know what I'm saying?
Butt-head: Yeah, except Katy Perry's not talking about you, Beavis. She's talking about that Dove model by the pool. You are a waste of space.
Beavis: Shut up, Butt-head.
Butt-head: You're more like that part of the song before where she's talking about the plastic bag floating around, but like, if it floated into a trash can, and then a bunch of stinky homeless dudes peed all over it.
Beavis: Shut up, Butt-head!
Butt-head: You're not a firework.

Butt-head: Yeah.
Beavis: That'd be cool if you had mirrors all over your clothes like that, and then like, you could use them to see your own taint. That would be cool.
Butt-head: I don't wanna see my taint. That's stupid.
Beavis: See, I'm always thinking.
%
Beavis: Whoa, check it out, Butt-head, it's Velvet Jones!

Butt-head: Because he's on TV, dumbass.
Beavis: Yeah, but how did he get on TV?
Butt-head: Because he's famous.
Beavis: Yeah, but, I mean, like, how did he get famous?

Beavis: Diving into the what?
Butt-head: The fishtank, Beavis!

Butt-head: Beavis, you think everything's a toilet.
Beavis: Well, there's fish in there, right? They go to the bathroom in there, right?
Butt-head: Yeah.
Beavis: So it's a toilet. See?
Butt-head: Yeah. They drink their own wee-wee.

Butt-head: Oh no, is this Yanni? [pause] Uhh...oh, this is Pink Floyd.
Beavis: Are they from England?
Butt-head: Yep. Just another gang of wussies from England.
%
Beavis: You know, I'd really like to go to England. You wanna know why, Butt-head?
Butt-head: Uhh, okay.
Beavis: Because, um, I just think, like you know, since everybody's a wussy over there, you know, I could just go around and kick everybody's ass, and then I could probably get some chicks because I'd be the only guy who's not a wussy. Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
Butt-head: Uhh, I think you'd probably be even be a wussy, like you know, to them.
Beavis: No way, Butt-head, I could kick some ass. They'd be like [sings] "The grass was greener..." and then I'd come up and kick 'em in the nads - "Wha-ha!" - and then I would score.
Butt-head: Yeah, but I think their nads are so small in England that, like, it'd be pretty easy to miss.
Beavis: Well, okay, so I'd kick 'em in somewhere else. Just...just shut up, you always mess up my...my dreams! Butthole!
Butt-head: Settle down, Beavis.
%
Beavis: You know, if you didn't know anything about these guys, and just heard the name "Pink Floyd", and then you heard this crap, you know, you'd probably think that it was just like, total wuss music.

Beavis: Whoa! Check it out, Butt-head! That's that guy from My Three Sons! That's Ernie from My Three Sons! See? Back in the doorway? That's him!
Butt-head: Oh yeah! That is him. Check this out. [Imitates Ernie] Hey Uncle Charley. Seems like a lot of work to me.
Beavis: [Also imitating Ernie] Hey Uncle Charley. I think I'll go put on a stupid dork outfit and go dance like a wuss for a while.
Butt-head: [Continuously imitating Ernie] Hey Uncle Charley. I think me and Chip are gonna dance around like a bunch of dorks.
Beavis: And then, like, Uncle Charley's like [Imitates Uncle Charley] Dammit Ernie, I’m trying to make a cake here! Will you get out of the kitchen and quit acting like a dork?!

Beavis: What?
Butt-head: If you eat your own boogers, does that make you, like, one of those "cannibists"?
Beavis: Yeah, it makes you one of those, one of those uh, uh, "cannilbulsists"!
Butt-head: How come boogers don't, like, stink?
Beavis: Yeah, yeah. I mean, it's like, they look ugly, so it's like you think they would stink.
Butt-head: Yeah. Actually, I think they look pretty cool!
Beavis: Yeah, yeah, me too!
%
Butt-head: This is so horrible, I can't even begin to talk about how much this sucks.
Beavis: Yeah yeah, really. Look at these buttknockers!

Beavis: And to think that this dude used to boff Pamela Anderson.
Butt-head: Like that would ever happen.
Beavis: I think it did happen. But anyway, she's on this thing with, um, this guy, his name is...Anthony Roberts, he has these tapes, and these things, and he makes you feel good. She watched him, and now she has huge hooters and she's on TV. It's pretty cool, I was thinking of getting some of those tapes.
Butt-head: Yeah, you'd look good with big hooters, Beavis.
Beavis: Shut up, Butt-head. You know that's not what I meant.
%
Beavis: You know who else Pamela Anderson boffed, is, uh, Scott Baio.
Butt-head: Uhh, really?
%
Butt-head: You know, this Poison dude kinda looks like Pamela Anderson.
Beavis: Yeah, you know, I was thinking, y'know, if he got some hooters, maybe he could be on Baywatch. You know, since his career sucks now, he probably doesn't have a job.
